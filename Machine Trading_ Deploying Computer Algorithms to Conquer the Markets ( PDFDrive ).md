he best way to learn something really well is to teach it to someone else
(Bargh and Schul, 1980). So I confess that one major motivation for my
writing this book, the third and the most advanced to date in a series, is to
force myself to study in more depth the following topics:
■The latest backtesting and trading platforms and the best and most
cost-effective vendors for all manners of data (Chapter 1);
■How to pick the best broker for algorithmic executions and what precau-
tions we should take (Chapter 1);
■The simplest way to optimize allocations to different assets and strategies
(Chapter 1);
■Factor models in all their glory, including those derived from the options
market, and why they can be useful to short-term traders (Chapter 2);
■Time series techniques: ARIMA, VAR, and state space models (with hid-
den variables) as applied to practical trading (Chapter 3);
■Artificial intelligence/machine learning techniques: particularly methods
that will reduce overfitting (Chapter 4);
■Options and volatility trading strategies, including those that involve
portfolios of options (Chapter 5);

■Intraday and higher frequency trading: market microstructure, order
types and routing optimization, dark pools, adverse selection, order
flow, and how to backtest intraday strategies with tick data (Chapter 6);
■Bitcoins: bringing some of the techniques we covered to this new asset
class (Chapter 7);
■How to keep up with the latest knowledge (Chapter 8);
■Transitioning from a proprietary trader to an investment advisor
(Chapter 8).
I don’t know if these topics will excite you or bring you profits, but my
study of them has certainly improved my own money management skills.
Besides, sharing knowledge and ideas is fun and ultimately conducive to cre-
ativity and profits.
You will find most of the materials quite accessible to anyone who has
some experience in a quantitative field, be it computer science, engineer-
ing, or physics. Not much prior knowledge of trading and finance is assumed
(except for the chapter on options, where we do assume basic familiar-
ity). However, if you are completely new to trading, you may find my more
basic treatments inQuantitative Trading(Chan, 2009) andAlgorithmic Trading
(Chan, 2013) easier to understand. This book can be treated as a continua-
tion of my first two books, with coverage on topics that I have not discussed
before, but it can also be read independently.
Although many prototype trading strategies have been included as
examples, one should definitely not treat them as shrink-wrapped products
ready to deploy in live trading. As I have emphasized in my previous
books, nobody should trade someone else’s strategies without a thorough,
independent backtest, removing all likely sources of biases and data errors,
and adding various variations for improvement. Most, if not all, the
strategies I describe contain hidden biases in one way or another, waiting
for you to unearth and eliminate.
I use MATLAB for all of my research in trading. I find it extremely
user-friendly, with constantly improving and new features, and with an
increasing number of specialized toolboxes that I can draw on. For example,
without the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox, it would take much
longer to explore using AI/ML techniques for trading. (See why Google
scientist and machine learning expert Kevin Murphy prefers MATLAB to R
for AI/ML research in Murphy, 2015.) In the past, readers have complained
about the high price of a MATLAB license. But now, it costs only $150 for a

‘‘Home’’ license, with each additional toolbox costing only $45. No serious
traders should compromise their productivity because of this small cost.
I am also familiar with R, which is a close relative to MATLAB. But frankly,
it is no match for MATLAB in terms of performance and user-friendliness.
A detailed comparison of these languages can be found in Chapters 1 and 6.
If you don’t already know MATLAB, it is very easy to request a one-month
trial license from mathworks.com and use its many free online tutorials
to learn the language. One great advantage of MATLAB over R or other
open-source languages is that there is excellent customer support: If you
have a question, just email or call the staff at Mathworks. (Often, someone
with a PhD will answer your questions.)
I have taught many of these topics to both retail and institutional traders
at my biannual workshops in London, as well as online (www.epchan.com).
In order to facilitate lecturers who would like to use this as a textbook for a
special topics course on Algorithmic Trading, I have included many exercises
at the end of most chapters. Some of these exercises should be treated as
suggestions for open-ended projects; there are no ready-made answers.
Readers will also find all of the software and some data used in the
examples on epchan.com/book3. The userid and password are embedded
in Box 1.1. But unlike my previous books, some of the data involved in
the example strategies are under strict licensing restrictions and therefore
are unavailable for free download from my website. Readers are invited
to purchase or rent them from their original sources, all of which are
described in Chapter 1.
I have benefited from tips, ideas, and help from many people in putting
the content together. An incomplete list would include:
■Stephen Aikin, a renowned author (Aikin, 2012) and lecturer, who helped
me understand implied quotes due to calendar spreads in the futures
markets (Chapter 6).
■David Don and Joseph Signorelli of Lime Brokerage, who corrected some
of my misunderstanding of the market microstructure (Chapter 6).
■Jonathan Shore, infinitely knowledgeable about bitcoins, who helped
compile some order book data in that market and shared that with me
(Chapter 7).
■Dr. Roger Hunter, CTO at our firm, QTS Capital Management, who
reviewed my manuscript and who never failed to find software bugs in
my codes.

■The team at Interactive Brokers (especially Joanne, Ragini, Mike, Greg,
Ian, and Ralph) whose infinite patience with my questions about all issues
related to trading are much appreciated.
I would like to thank Professor Thomas Miller of Northwestern Uni-
versity for hiring me to teach the Risk Analytics course at the Master of
Science in Predictive Analytics program. In the same vein, I would also
like to thank Matthew Clements and Jim Biss at Global Markets Training
for organizing the London workshops for me over the years. Quite a few
nuggets of knowledge in this book come out of materials or discussions
from these courses and workshops.
Trading and research have been made a lot more interesting and enjoyable
because I was able to work closely with our team at QTS, who contributed
to research, ideas, and general knowledge, some of which find their way into
this book. Among them, Roger, of course, without whom there wouldn’t be
QTS, but also Yang, Marcin, Sam, and last but not least, Ray.
Of course, none of my books would come into existence without the
support of Wiley, especially my long-time editor Bill Falloon, development
editor Julie Kerr, production editor Caroline Maria, and copy editor Cheryl
Ferguson (from whom no missing ‘‘end’’ to a ‘‘for’’-loop can escape). It was
truly a great pleasure to work with them, and their enthusiasm and profes-
sionalism are greatly appreciated.

## The Basics

n algorithmic trading strategy feeds market data (historical or live) into
a computer (backtest or automated execution) program. The program
then submits orders to the broker through an API, and receives order status
notifications back from the broker. The flowchart in Figure 1.1 illustrates
this process.
Notice that I deliberately use the same box to indicate the computer pro-
gram that generates backtest results and live orders: This is the best way to
ensure we are trading the exact same model that we have backtested.
In this chapter, I will discuss the latest services, products, and their ven-
dors applicable to each of the blocks in Figure 1.1. In addition, I will describe
my favorite performance metrics, the way to determine the optimal lever-
age, and the simplest asset allocation method. Though I have touched on
many (but not all) of these issues in my previous books, I have updated them
here based on the state of the art. The FinTech industry has not been stand-
ing still, nor has my understanding of issues ranging from brokers’ safety to
subtleties of portfolio optimization.

■Historical Market Data
Fordaily historical data in stocks and futures, I have been using CSI
(csidata.com) for a long time. CSI has a very flexible, and robust, desk-
top application. The beauty of this application is that we can set a time
in the evening when the data are automatically updated through an Inter-
net connection with CSI’s server. Also, the data can be stored in various
convenient formats such as .txt, .csv, or .xlsx. We can ask it to automati-
cally adjust historical stock (and ETF) prices for splits and dividends. For a
little extra, CSI can also provide delisted stocks’ historical data, so that you
can have a survivorship-bias-free data set.
## 1
(By the way, CSI data powers
Yahoo! Finance’s historical stock data.) For futures, we can choose different
rollover methods to create continuous contracts. Or not, since the origi-
nal contract prices are also available, and many professional traders prefer
to backtest futures using original contract prices instead of back-adjusted
continuous contract prices. This is because the latter depends on a particu-
lar roll method, and may have look-ahead bias embedded (see Chan, 2013,

for a detailed exploration of this issue). Finally, CSI has excellent customer
support through email and phone.
An alternative to CSI is Quandl.com, which is a consolidator of many
kinds of data from many different vendors. It also provides an API in different
languages (including MATLAB, which I use in this book, or Python, which
many other traders use) that we can use for data selection and download.
Some of Quandl’s data are free (daily data for stocks is one example), and
others require payment. I have purchased, for example, fundamental stock
data from them (see Chapter 2, Factor Models), and they are much more
economical than established vendors such as Compustat.
Serious traders or academic finance researchers may prefer stock, ETF,
and mutual fund data from CRSP (www.crsp.com). Their historical data
are carefully compiled to be survivorship-bias-free, and dividends and splits
are provided separately so you can decide how to utilize them in a back-
test. But most importantly, they provide the best bid and offer (BBO) prices
at the close. These are important because, as is explained in Box 6.2 in
Chapter 6, using the usual consolidated closing prices from CSI or Quandl
can inflate backtest performances for certain strategies. A similar issue arises
from using the consolidated opening prices. The best open and close prices
to use are the auction prices from the primary exchange. (See also Box 6.2
for an explanation of how we can extract such auction prices from tick data.)
The second best open and close prices to use are the BBO prices that can be
used to compute the midprices at the open and close. Unfortunately CRSP
does not provide the BBO prices at the open, so one must use intraday data
for that purpose. For academic researchers, CRSP data can be obtained at
a lower cost through WRDS (wrds-web.wharton.upenn.edu), which is a
consolidator of many high quality historical databases for scholarly research.
Of course, those serious traders who can afford to buy data from CRSP
may also be able to afford a Bloomberg terminal subscription. One advantage
of a Bloomberg terminal is that we can download the ‘‘primary exchange’’
close price for US stocks. Of course, a Bloomberg subscription also includes
access to many historical and live data spanning a wide variety of instruments
and, importantly, breaking news on every stock. I have found Bloomberg’s
news service to be superior to many other vendors’. Often, we will see a
stock moves suddenly, and are not able to find the reason anywhere else but
on Bloomberg’s news feed. They do capture the most obscure news on the
most obscure stocks in the shortest time frame, which is important when
you have an event-driven strategy. Bloomberg’s historical US stock data are
also survivorship-bias-free. (To be fair to Thomson Reuter’s Eikon platform,

Trim Size: 6in x 9inChan  c01.tex  V2 - 12/11/2016  12:44 A.M.  Page 4

which is a keen competitor to Bloomberg’s, I have not tested its news feed.
So it is possible that it provides just as wide and timely coverage as well.
There is one feature on Eikon that impressed me in a demo: I was able to
see the geographical locations of individual oil tankers and where they were
headed. Apparently, this is useful to oil traders to predict short-term oil
inventory, supply, and demand.)
Forfutures traders, daily data does not present much of a problem.
CSIs and the free data on Quandl are as good as any.
Daily options datacan be obtained from ORATS.com as well as
ivolatility.com. Both offerings are survivorship-bias-free. The institutional
trader or academic researcher may also purchase from Option Metrics,
which is often part of the WRDS package (see above). One nice feature
of all these databases: They do not include just option closing prices, but
also the bid-ask quote at the close as well. This is important because some
options, especially ones that are out-of-the-money or have long tenor,
may be traded infrequently. So the last trade price of the day may be very
different from the bid-ask quotes at the close, and is not indicative of the
price we can actually trade at or near the close. These databases also include
auxiliary but important information such as the Greeks and implied volatil-
ities. Furthermore, they may include an implied volatility surface. This uses
implied volatilities computed on actual options and interpolates them to
yield implied volatilities for strikes and tenors that did not actually exist.
Options historical data tend to be more expensive than stock or futures
data, due to their voluminous nature. However, it can be cheaper to rent
intradayoption prices from QuantGo.com than to buydailyoption prices
from other vendors. We will talk more about QuantGo when we discuss
intraday data in general. It would be a trivial programming exercise to
extract the end-of-day quotes from the intraday data, by looking for the
quotes with timestamps at or just before the daily closing time.
Beyond daily price data, there are, of course,fundamental financial
datafor companies. I already mentioned that Quandl carries such data.
Institutional traders would most likely look to Compustat for such data. For
corporate earnings estimates by analysts, Thomson Reuters’ IBES database
is the standard. Both Compustat and IBES are available from WRDS.
Meanwhile, crowd-sourced earnings estimates are available from Estimize.
There is some research that suggests Estimize’s contributors can more
accurately forecast actual earnings than traditional sell-side analysts (Wang
et al., 2014). An example strategy using Estimize’s data is discussed
in Deltix (2014). Short interest data are available from Compustat and

SunGard’s Astec database. SunGard’s data have a lot more details culled
from stock lenders and prime brokers around the Street than a simple short
interest number. In addition, their data are available on an intraday basis as
a live feed, though the historical data do not have historical time stamps.
News datais another type of data that is becoming fashionable. Many
vendors sell elementized news feeds (i.e., news that is machine-readable,
which makes it easier to capture keywords, categories, and the like),
including Bloomberg, Dow Jones, and Thomson Reuters. If it is too much
trouble for your strategy to generate trading signals from raw news data,
you can also buy news sentiment data from Ravenpack, Thomson Reuters
News Analytics, MarketPsych, or Accern. (AcquireMedia’s NewsEdge
database is similar, but they provide only impact scores. This is a kind of
unsigned sentiment score that doesn’t tell you which way the stock will
move, only that it will move, which may be suitable for options traders.)
However, there is one problem for sentiment data: Different vendors have
different ways to compute sentiment scores from the raw news. So a trading
model depends to some extent on which vendors’ sentiment scores are most
predictive.
We will leave the topic of buying or renting intraday data to Chapter 6 on
Intraday Trading, because the features associated with intraday data are inti-
matelytiedtothemarketmicrostructure.Here,wewilljustnotethatsomeof
the historical intraday data vendors include tickdata.com, nanex.net, CQG,
QuantGo.com, kibot, and of course, the various exchanges themselves.
Finding, buying, or renting data is both expensive and time-consuming,
though consolidators like Quandl and QuantGo have made it much less so.
Another way to avoid dealing with acquiring data directly is to adopt a trading
platform that comes integrated with data (though you may have to pay for
the data separately). A good example is Quantopian.com, which provides
free US stock trades data with one-minute bars, together with many other
forms of fundamental and news data at lower frequency. (I have been told
that futures data will be available soon.) We will talk more about platforms
like these in the section ‘‘Backtesting and Trading Platforms.’’
■Live Market Data
Most if not all brokerages provide live market data to their clients, and if
you are trading a daily strategy (i.e., you trade only at the market open or
close), such data are usually more than sufficient. However, if you engage

Trim Size: 6in x 9inChan  c01.tex  V2 - 12/11/2016  12:44 A.M.  Page 6
## MACHINE TRADING
## 

## 
in intraday trading, then the quality of data becomes a bigger issue. As we
will discuss more thoroughly in Chapter 6, low latency market data can be
quite expensive to obtain. Vendors that provide data suitable for intraday
trading that can tolerate a latency of more than 25 ms (ms=millisecond)
include eSignal, IQFeed, CQG, Interactive Data, Bloomberg, and many
others. But vendors that provide data feed with latency of below 10 ms are
far fewer: They include S&P Capital IQ (formerly QuantHouse), SR Labs,
and Thomson Reuters. Of course, you can also subscribe to the direct feeds
from the exchange, but that is strictly for high frequency traders who find
the high expense justified by the high return. (That is true unless you are
after currency data, where most FX exchanges will give their customer a
free direct feed.)
As with historical market data, many trading platforms also include live
market data feeds. These will be discussed in the following section.
■Backtesting and Trading Platforms
Traditionally, we would backtest our trading strategy on one platform (e.g.,
R) and once successful, write a different program to automate execution of
the strategy that utilizes a broker’s API. However, this proves to be quite
bug-prone: there is no way to ensure that the backtest and the live trad-
ing program encapsulate exactly the same trading logic. Fortunately, most
backtest platforms nowadays have extended their ability to execute live as
well; hence, we will combine the discussions on backtesting and trading plat-
forms here.
As I mentioned in the Preface, MATLAB has been my favorite backtest-
ing platform. It has a very comprehensive and user-friendly interface for
developing and debugging programs, and it has a wide array of toolboxes
that cover almost every arcane mathematical or computational technique
you will likely encounter in trading strategy development. One of these
toolboxes, the Trading Toolbox, enables a MATLAB program to connect
to a number of brokerages’ APIs to receive market data, submit orders,
and receive order status notifications. If you prefer not to buy the Trading
Toolbox, there are at least three adaptors developed by third-party vendors
that enable you to do the same: exchangeapi.com’s quant2ib, undocument-
edmatlab.com’s IB-Matlab, and Jev Kuznetsov’s free MATLAB-to-IB API
available at MATLAB’s File Exchange. I have discussed these options in
some depth in Chan (2013). Finally, MATLAB is fast. (See Chapter 6 for

a comparison of performance speed among MATLAB, R, and Python.)
The only drawback for this platform is that it isn’t free, but the ‘‘Home’’
license costs only $150, with each additional toolbox costing an extra $45.
If you plan to buy MATLAB’s Toolboxes, here are the three I recommend
(in decreasing order of importance): Statistics and Machine Learning,
Econometrics, and Financial Instruments (for options traders).
For those who prefer free, open-source platforms, there are always R and
## Python.
R is very similar to MATLAB: It is an array-processing language, and it
has a large variety of specialized ‘‘packages’’ (the analogue of MATLAB’s
toolboxes), many of them perhaps more sophisticated than MATLAB’s due
to the large number of academic researchers who use R. There is a GUI
development platform called RStudio, but I find its user interface to be quite
crude compared to that of MATLAB, and hence debugging productivity is
lower. R is also the slowest among the three languages, and the slowness
is all the more problematic because, unlike MATLAB or Python, it cannot
be compiled into C or C++code for speeding up. (You can, however, use
the Rcpp package to access compiled C++code from within R.) As for
automating executions, you can connect an R program to Interactive Brokers
through a package called ‘‘IBroker.’’
Python is a language in the ascendant, though I know of quants who used
it for backtesting back in 1998. Aside from being a standalone language of
choice for many quantitative traders, platforms such as Quantopian also use
it as their strategy specification language. Native Python is not an array pro-
cessing language (though one can use SciPy packages which do have this
feature). While array processing is convenient for backtesting a large num-
ber of instruments simultaneously (e.g., portfolio of stocks), it is not useful
for writing an automated execution program. Hence, if we were to insist
on using the same program for both backtesting and live execution, we can
disregard this feature altogether. One major advantage of Python is that its
codes can be developed and debugged using Microsoft’s Visual Studio, thus
piggybacking on the full power of this well-polished development environ-
ment. Another integrated development environment
## 2
(IDE) for Python that
received good reviews is PyCharm. Python’s pandas library is a data analysis
package similar to R, and the rpy2 package provides an interface to access all
R packages. Python isn’t as fast as MATLAB, though it is faster than R, and
can be compiled into C or C++.

In Table 1.1, I provide my personal, arguably subjective, ranking of the
various features and aspects of the three scripting languages most widely
used in trading strategy development.
You may be wondering why I have left out some of the most common
programming languages such as C/C++, Java, or C#. The fact is, the most
productive way to develop trading strategies is to quickly build prototype
programs to test a lot of them, and to quickly discard them if they fail to live
up to their promises. Scripting languages (also called REPL
## 4
languages) like
MATLAB, R, or Python allow us to shorten this research cycle. However,
productivity in research is not the same as productivity in building an auto-
mated trading system. The latter usually involves the usual bells and whistles
of software development such as object-oriented design, exception han-
dling, version control, memory and speed optimization, and so forth. Such
bells and whistles are actually quite cumbersome to implement in a script-
ing language, and, furthermore, it is quite easy to introduce bugs without a
robust and extensible software architecture. Typically, once object-oriented
design is imposed on a scripting language, it will run too slowly to be useful
as an execution system.
To benefit from the best of both worlds, in our firm we do our initial
research mostly in MATLAB or Python (though I often ask our research
associates to test their strategies on Quantopian first, just to make sure their
codes do not have look-ahead bias). After we settle on a strategy, our CTO,
Roger, will then independently build a system in C# that can both backtest

and execute live the same strategy, as a way to confirm the correctness of the
initial backtest. Once it is confirmed, a figurative turn of the key will allow
us to trade live, with much lower latency than if we were to execute using
a scripting language. In building the execution system, we can often reuse
existing classes that we have written for other strategies. This way, we have
compressed the research life cycle without sacrificing software correctness,
component reuse, or execution efficiency.
There are now many backtesting and automated execution platforms
available that purport to make it easier to develop and deploy automated
trading strategies both quickly and robustly, just like what I described in the
last paragraph, but without using two different languages. I have written
extensively about this in Chan (2013), so here I will restrict myself to those
platforms that fit the following criteria:
- It has integrated historical and live market data, or provides adaptors
for popular data vendors.
- It allows maximum flexibility in strategy design by relying on generic
programming languages such as Python or Java.
- It allows connection to popular broker APIs.
- It allows backtesting and live trading in US equities, among other instru-
ments.
The platforms that satisfy these criteria are Quantopian, QuantConnect,
Ninjatrader, Marketcetera, AlgoTrader, OpenQuant, Deltix, and Quant-
House. (This is, of course, not an exhaustive list.) Some of these platforms,
such as Quantopian, are free, while others, such as QuantHouse, have a price
tag suitable for institutional traders.
If you are trading a high frequency strategy, it is possible that many of
these platforms will not be adequate: either because they may be too slow,
or because they are missing level 2 quotes. But there are platforms such
as Lime Brokerage’s Strategy Studio that are designed specifically for such
demanding tasks. More about this will be discussed in Chapter 6.
Though these platforms have certainly made it easier to backtest and auto-
mate trading strategies, they usually come with some constraints on the
exact type of strategies, data, or instruments that we are allowed to test.
Not surprisingly, the more expensive a platform is, the more flexible it is.
But if absolute flexibility coupled with low development cost is required,
you will probably have to do what we do in our firm.

■Brokers
In this day and age, practically every broker will offer customers an API
where they can subscribe to market data, submit orders, and receive order
status notifications: See the last two blocks on the right of Figure 1.1. Of
course, the ease of use and comprehensiveness of their APIs differ widely.
If you would rather not deal directly with the vagaries and low-level details
of each broker’s API, you can use one of the automated execution platforms
that I described in the previous section.
Meanwhile, commissions are generally so low that it also isn’t a crucial
factor in deciding who to trade with. Brokers have other ways to make
money from you besides commissions. One popular way, for some
stockbrokers, is ‘‘payment for order flow.’’ Essentially, when you send your
order to this broker, it will forward your order to a particular market maker
or a specific exchange for a rebate (e.g., a penny per share), and let them
execute this order. Brokers who do this must inform their customers of this
practice when they open their accounts. If you prefer not to let your broker
earn this rebate, and instead want to pocket it yourself, you can use brokers
with Direct Market Access (e.g., Interactive Brokers or Lime Brokerage).
For some FX brokers, a popular way to earn money is to widen the bid-offer
spread on a currency pair. This way, they earn the difference between the
spread they offer you and the spread they have to pay in the interbank
market where they execute your trade. This can make it hard to compare
costs among different FX brokers, since this extra spread may change over
time, but of course this is precisely the reason why some brokers adopt
the practice. If you prefer transparency, you can restrict your search to FX
brokers that only charge commissions, not spread.
If you are a futures or currency trader, there is one more item about your
broker that you have to worry about: financial stability. For US securities
(i.e., stocks trading) accounts, many traders know that their cash
## 5
is insured
up to $250,000 by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC).
Many brokers also provide additional insurance through a private insurance
company such as Lloyd’s of London. However, none of this is applicable
to commodities futures trading accounts—hence the furor in wake of the
MF Global and PFGBest bankruptcies (MarketWatch, 2012). It would be
pointless to advise you to ascertain the financial strength of a commodi-
ties broker before opening an account: If the National Futures Association
(NFA) couldn’t detect that some of these large brokers (called Futures Com-
mission Merchants, or FCM) are not meeting capital requirement or are

committing fraud, what chance do we have? However, there is one way out
of this conundrum: If a securities broker is also an FCM, it might offer a
way to automatically sweep the excess cash
## 6
from an uninsured commodi-
ties account into an insured securities account. (For example, Interactive
Brokers offers such a cash sweep service.)
Currency traders may have heard ofHerstatt risk,or settlement risk
(Galati, 2002). To illustrate, let’s say we have sold 1 million EURUSD to
a bank, and have delivered 1 million EUR to it. But before this bank can
send us the corresponding amount of USD, it collapses (as was the case
with Bankhaus Herstatt in Germany, 1974). We won’t be getting our USD
any time soon, and have lost 1 million EUR. It is a risk that is not solved
by having an account at a reputable FX broker, because your counterparty
may be some bank in a faraway country, and your broker isn’t liable for
your loss. This scenario is often used by some uninformed financial advisors
to scare customers off investing in foreign currency strategies or funds.
However, since the establishment of the CLS bank in 2002, an institution
owned by some of the largest banks in the world, this risk has been largely
eliminated. The CLS bank is a US financial institution regulated by the US
Federal Reserve, and it facilitates simultaneous settlement of both legs of
a currency transaction. It can do so because it maintains accounts with 18
central banks around the world. In our example above, we will receive
the USD payment at the same time our counterparty receives our EUR
payment, all via the CLS bank. It is almost like transacting on a stock
exchange, where we are guaranteed that if we sold some shares, payment
for those shares would be forthcoming, even if the trader who bought our
shares went bankrupt. The 18 central banks whose currencies settle in
CLS are listed at www.cls-group.com/About/Pages/Currencies.aspx, and
these are the currencies that have little or no settlement risk.
We have been discussing the risks that other parties (brokers or
counterparties) fail to pay us in a transaction. But what if we are the ones
who fail? More specifically, what if in a levered transaction, we lost more
money in the brokerage account than our account equity? Are we liable
to the negative equity? Can we lose more than what we invested in the
account? The answer is yes and yes, if we invested as individuals. In a
particularly poignant example, on January 15, 2015, the Swiss National
Bank (Switzerland’s central bank) suddenly announced that the Swiss Franc
would no longer be pegged to the euro (Economist, 2015). EURCHF
plummeted by about 10 percent in seconds, and ultimately lost 29 percent
in a day. Many FX traders’ account equities went negative. Some smaller FX

brokers failed because their customers wouldn’t pay them back the losses.
In a situation like this, how do we make sure we won’t be liable? The way to
protect ourselves is not to invest in our own personal or family’s name, but
through a limited liability vehicle that we fully own, such as a corporation
(or S-corporation in the United States), limited liability company (in the
United States), or limited partnership. Investing in someone else’s limited
partnership, such as a hedge fund, will also work. In case of negative equity,
the limited liability vehicle will have to declare bankruptcy. This isn’t great,
but is not catastrophic.
■Performance Metrics
What performance metrics should a backtest program generate? I am typi-
cally interested in only five of them: CAGR (compound annual growth rate),
Sharpe ratio, Calmar ratio, maximum drawdown, and maximum drawdown
duration. I have discussed most of these except the Calmar ratio in detail in
my previous books, so I will just briefly highlight some of their usage here.
CAGR is a bit different from average annualized returns: It assumes we
do not transfer cash into or out of an account each time period, while main-
taining the same leverage throughout. To take an extreme example, if a
strategy returns 1 percent per trading day, CAGR will be 1.01
## 252
## −1=
1127 percent. That’s compounding at work. On the other hand, the aver-
age annualized return would be just 252×0.01=252 percent, and it is
the return we would get if we withdraw profit or add cash to make up for
losses each time period. But I emphasize that we must keep the leverage
constant to achieve this compounded growth. In other words, your posi-
tions or orders must be resized each day based on the account equity and the
leverage—something that an automated trading program should be able to
do quite easily.
In a backtest, I recommend we set the leverage to one. Otherwise, the
higher the leverage we use, the higher will be the CAGR, up to a point as
determined by the Kelly formula below. So it is quite meaningless to pick an
arbitrary leverage for a backtest. But to ensure that the leverage is one, one
must make sure that the returns are measured by taking the Profit and Loss
(P&L) and divide that by the total gross market value of the position(s). For
example, if we are long $100 of stock A while short $100 of stock B, and
the P&L is $1, the unlevered return is just 0.5 percent.

I have written a lot before about using the Kelly formula (Chan, 2009):
Optimal leverage=
Mean of Excess Returns
Variance of Excess Returns
If we leverage our strategy or portfolio higher than this optimal leverage,
CAGR may start to go down with increasing leverage, and is almost guaran-
teed to be−100 percent when the leverage is high enough. But often, it isn’t
safe even if the leverage is equal to the Kelly optimal. I have found that Kelly’s
leverage is typically too high to be of practical use. The Kelly formula shown
above assumes Gaussian distribution of returns: Risk is measured only by
the second moment of returns. So let’s consider a simulated excess returns
series with a mean of about 0.05 percent and standard deviation of about
1 percent. This is not too different from the actual daily returns statistics
of SPY minus the risk-free rate. Kelly formula would therefore recommend
a leverage of 5. But suppose one of the days has a return of−20 percent,
which is also close to the actual return of SPY on Black Monday, Octo-
ber 19, 1987. If we are long SPY with a leverage of 5, our equity would
have been wiped out on that day, no thanks to Kelly. As a practical matter,
I would recommend lowering the leverage until you are comfortable with
the maximum drawdown in the backtest over a period that includes several
financial crises.
Sharpe ratio is a risk-adjusted return measure that everybody uses, but
its utility is limited because it also implicitly assumes that the returns dis-
tribution is Gaussian. Risk is again measured only by the standard deviation
(volatility) of returns. But as everyone knows, returns distribution have ‘‘fat
tails’’: abnormally large returns of either sign occur far more frequently
than is predicted by a Gaussian distribution. Maximum drawdown is a much
better measure of tail risks, as it does not rely on measuring just the second
moment of returns distribution. (Maximum drawdown is also asymmetric:
We are not concerned about periods with extremely positive returns.)
Hence, I have been in favor of using the Calmar ratio instead: it is defined as
the CAGR divided by the absolute value of the maximum drawdown over the
most recent three years. Some people prefer to use the MAR ratio instead,
which is the same as the Calmar ratio except that the maximum drawdown
is over the entire history of the backtest (or live track record). One can
see that Calmar ratio is better defined than the MAR ratio: The longer the

## 
backtest, the higher the absolute value of the maximum drawdown. So it
doesn’t quite make sense to have a measure that depends sensitively on the
length of a backtest or a track record. Three years is a way of normalizing
this measure. I prefer to trade strategies that have a backtest Calmar ratio of
at least 1.
■Portfolio Optimization
When we are trading multiple strategies, or holding positions in multiple
instruments in a portfolio, how we allocate capital among them can be as
important to our total return as how these strategies perform individually.
This issue of portfolio optimization has been well-studied in academic
finance research, although there are some subtleties that are worth
highlighting.
Before we get into the details, we should differentiate between maximiz-
ing the return of a portfolio over one period (e.g., a day, a month, or a year)
versus maximizing the compound return (CAGR) of the portfolio over an
infinite horizon. The former is dealt with by the familiar Markowitz portfolio
optimization method. Its objective is to maximize the expected return sub-
ject to a constant variance of returns constraint; or equivalently and more
conventionally, to minimize the variance of returns subject to a constant
expected return constraint.
In order to compute the expected return and variance of returns over
one period, let’s assume our portfolio hasNinstruments (stocks, bonds,
futures, etc.) or strategies (mean-reverting, momentum, event-driven,
options, etc.) From here on, we will use the generic terminstruments
to denote such components of a portfolio. Each instrumentihas an
expected returnm
i
. We assume that these returns have a covarianceC
i,j
## .
Note that by return here we mean net return, not log return. This dis-
tinction will become important later on. To clarify, net return in this
context is calculated as
Net return(t)=
## Price(t)
## Price(t−1)
## −1,
while log return is calculated as
Log return(t)=log(Price(t)) −log(Price(t−1)).

Net returns can never have Gaussian distributions in principle (the ‘‘why’’
is left as an exercise), but log returns can. There is an interesting relationship
between the mean log return휇and the mean net returnmof a price series
if the log returns have normal distribution:

## (1.1)
wheresis the standard deviation of the net return. This is also approximately
equal to the standard deviation of the log return; hence, we can use the same
symbol to represent both. The approximate equality in equation 1.1 will
become exact as we subdivide the periods into smaller and smaller subperi-
ods, so that we approach continuous time (see Box 1.1). It can be derived
from Ito’s Lemma, famous in continuous finance as a foundational formula
for Black-Scholes options pricing formula. This equality will be useful when
we try to maximize the expected compound growth rate later on.
Box 1.1: The mean of net vs. log returns
In this example, we will demonstrate numerically that equation 1.1 is
approximately true when log returns have a Gaussian distribution, and
that as we subdivide a time period into more and more subperiods, the
approximation becomes exact.
Let’s say that the log return over some time period has a mean of
100 percent and a standard deviation of 200 percent. We will use the

Box 1.2: Calculating the efficient frontier using
quadratic programming
In this example, we will numerically determine the efficient frontier
of a portfolio of ETFs, with the constraint that no short position is
allowed, and the weights of all the ETFs must add to 1 (i.e., no leverage
on the portfolio is allowed). The set of ETF we use are EWC, EWG,
EWJ, EWQ, EWU, and EWY. The efficient frontier is the set of min-
imum variances given a set of fixed expected returns. The first task in
constructing the efficient frontier is to find the maximum and mini-
mum expected returns possible. Given the no-leverage constraint, we
know that the maximum (minimum) expected return is obtained when
we have a weight of 1 on the ETF with the highest (lowest) expected
return, and a weight of 0 on all other ETFs. If R is the array with each
column representing the daily returns of one ETF over many days, we
can compute the mean and the covariance of returns as
mi=mean(R, 1); % average return of each stock i.
C=cov(R); % covariance of returns

and the set of expected returns we want to consider for our efficient
frontier is
m=[min(mi):(max(mi)-min(mi))/20:max(mi)];
These expected returns are the constraints for our variance
minimization function. We will use MATLAB’s Optimization Tool-
box’s quadratic programming functionquadprogfor this task. The
objective function to be minimized is a quadratic function of the
capital allocation vectorF. From MATLAB’s help manual,X = quad-

The tangency portfolio is found by maximizing the Sharpe ratio:
sd=sqrt(v);
sharpeRatio=m./sd;
[∼, idx]=max(sharpeRatio);
beq=[m(idx); 1];
[F]=quadprog(H, f, A, b, Aeq, beq)
The resulting weights areF=(0.45, 0.26, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.29).
The minimum variance portfolio to be discussed in the main text is
found by (what else?) minimizing the variance or standard deviation:
[∼, idxMin]=min(sd);
scatter(sd(idxMin), m(idxMin), 'green', 'filled');
beq=[m(idxMin); 1];
[F]=quadprog(H, f, A, b, Aeq, beq)
The resulting allocations areF=(0.38, 0.00, 0.60, 0.00, 0.01,

nents are all non-negative and sum to 1. The complete code can be

Maximizing the Sharpe ratio may seem intuitively like a good
thing, but actually what many investors (like myself) want is to
maximize the expected compound growth rate of the portfolio over
an infinite (or indefinite) time horizon. Fortunately, it turns out
that maximizing the expected compound growth rate is equivalent
to maximizing the Sharpe ratio. To prove this, we first recognize
that the expected compound growth rate is just휇, the expected log
return (see exercise 1.21 for proof). By equation 1.1, this is equal to

denotes the optimal allocation. But this is

portfolio isF

It turns out that maximizing 1-period return subject to a variance

In Box 1.2, we have minimized the variance of a portfolio for a given
level of expected return. We did this numerically, using quadratic pro-
gramming techniques. However, if we simply want to find the capital
allocation corresponding to the tangency portfolio, we can do this ana-
lytically by maximizing the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio, subject to a
constant leverage constraint. (The constant leverage can be set to 1
without loss of generality.) In other words, we want to maximize the

Mis a solution to this equation, which is
the Kelly optimal allocation formula I have described in Chan (2009),
and which maximizes the Sharpe ratio of a portfolio of instruments.
All this classical financial mathematics is elegant and satisfying, but reality
often intrudes. The main problem is simple to understand: Past returns are
not a good predictor of future returns. So the optimal allocation for the past
is not necessarily the optimal allocation for the future. On the other hand,
covariances are easier to predict than returns. Also, while the estimates
of expected returns do not improve with larger sample size, estimates of

covariances do (Ang, 2014). If we don’t have returns estimates but still have
covariances estimates, we can construct aminimum variance portfolio—that is,
an allocation that minimizes the variance of returns of the portfolio. This is
also marked on Figure 1.2. A side benefit of the minimum variance portfolio
is that research has shown that low volatility stocks consistently outperform
high volatility stocks (Baker et al., 2011). In the last 20 years, investors have
increasingly favored minimum variance over tangency portfolio, giving rise
to such ETFs as SPLV, ACWV, EEMV, and USMV.
Some investors have gone even further: They distrust even the covariance
of returns and rely solely on the volatilities of individual stocks in making
their capital allocation. Such is the case with the so-calledrisk parity portfolio,
where capital allocated to each asset is inversely proportional to its volatility
(Asness, 2012). In essence, this is targeting the same risk for each asset
in the portfolio, hence the namerisk parity. The ETF SPLV is constituted
using this principle, and so is the famous $70 billion Bridgewater Associates
All Weather fund. However, many risk management strategies have
backfired due to their penchant for creating contagion. In other words,
if everybody is adopting the same risk management strategy, everybody’s
risk will increase instead. For example, let’s say everybody follows Kelly
formula’s advice to keep the leverage of their portfolio constant, and
everybody’s portfolio contains similar stocks. Then a loss in value of this
portfolio will cause everybody to liquidate holdings, driving the (net
asset) value of this portfolio even lower, and forcing further liquidation.
The same problem is present for risk parity portfolios. If the market
suffers a meltdown, volatility tends to increase, forcing risk parity funds
to liquidate. Well, you know the rest of the story. This happened in the
fall of 2015, when a combination of Chinese economic woes and crashing
oil prices caused a market panic. The All Weather fund lost 7 percent in
2015, and was blamed for starting just such a contagion (Copeland and
## Martin, 2015).
In addition to the contagious liquidation problem discussed above, target-
ing the same volatility for each component of a portfolio also relies on the
implicit Gaussian assumption that volatility is bad. But volatility isn’t what
we should be afraid of—tail risk is. As discussed in the section ‘‘Performance
Metrics,’’ maximum drawdown is a good measure of tail risk. So I suggest
we should target the same maximum drawdown for each component of a
portfolio if you are into the risk parity allocation method.

preferably longer. The reason some of us are reluctant to do so (at least,
not for 100 percent of our net worth) is market risk: buying-and-holding
the stock index has long periods of drawdowns. We may be forced to liq-
uidate some of that holding to raise cash at a most inopportune time. What
if we instead hold a long-short market-neutral portfolio? For example, we
may hear that value stocks offer better long-term returns than growth stocks
(after all, the value investor Warren Buffett is very rich). So why not just
long value stocks and short growth stocks? That actually works quite well,

except during the dotcom bubble in the late 1990s, when this portfolio, too,
came to grief. Just because this portfolio doesn’t have market risk doesn’t
mean it doesn’t have some other risk associated with long value and short
growth. In fact, many of the strategies we will discuss in this book, whether
they trade stocks or options, have such so-called factor risks. For example,
many of the strategies in the options chapter are exposed to the volatility
risk factor—they do poorly when volatility increases. They are by no means
riskless arbitrage. In fact, their risks are unlike the random fluctuations of
white noise—the factor risk of each stock is bothseriallyandcross-sectionally
correlated over a period of time. For our long-value short-growth portfolio,
we are almost sure that it will lose money for long periods when we have
‘‘irrational exuberance.’’ For our (short) options strategies, we are almost
sure that they will lose in those periods when volatility increases, and that is
true for practically any options you trade.

Traders and investors justifiably like to chase after ‘‘alphas’’—returns that
are not known to be associated with factor risks. Earning alpha is almost
riskless arbitrage, because their risks can be reduced to zero by increasing
diversification. The more stocks one includes in a portfolio with positive
alpha, the smaller the (white noise) risk compared to its return. On the
other hand, factor risk cannot be diversified away. No matter how many value
stocks you add to the long side of a portfolio, and how many growth stocks
you add to the short side, the factor risk remains unchanged. But because
everybody loves alpha, it is especially hard to find. Every time someone finds
alpha, they have to keep it a secret. And still, more and more people will
discover it eventually, and the alpha diminishes. Even if nobody else finds it,
alpha has limited capacity, so eventually it diminishes if too much capital has
been applied to it. Factor risk is different. It is hardly a secret that investing
in the market index will generate positive return in the long term, yet many
people still shy away from the stock market because of the undiversifiable
risk. It is hardly a secret that selling options will generate positive return in
the long term (as the longevity of the insurance industry testifies), yet many
people are still afraid of doing so because of the likely sharp drawdown in
times of financial crises. Because of these risks, most factor returns remain
alive and well, year after year. This is the reason why we will study factor
models in this chapter, despite their relative lack of sex appeal compared
to alpha generation. Also, trading factor models makes you a more sociable
person, since you don’t need to hide what you do for a living from your
colleagues lest they steal your alphas.

(It is true that some factor returns do decrease over time, such as
the SMB factor we will discuss in the time-series factors section, or the
put-call implied volatilities factor in the Using Option Prices section. Their
returns decrease likely because investors perceive that the associated factor
risks have decreased as well. In the SMB case, investors may believe that
small-cap stocks are no more risky than large-cap stocks, as long as we are
sufficiently diversified. After all, Enron and Lehman Brothers were both
large-cap stocks.)
As I wrote above, many of the strategies I describe later in the book
have implicit factor exposures, though one cannot call themfactor models.
This term is confined to simple linear models, where the predictors in the
linear regression are our factors. This is also the reason why the regression
coefficients for factors are sometimes calledsmart betas,a ‘‘dumb’’ beta
being the regression coefficient between the return of a stock versus
the return of the market index. I will describe the difference between
time-series and cross-sectional factors, some of the new and interesting

factors that researchers have discovered ranging from fundamental to
option-implied, how surprisingly well you can do when all you have is price
data, and the different ways to implement a factor model.
■Time-series Factors
The two factors mentioned earlier in this chapter, the market return and the
value-minus-growth return, are examples of time-series factors (Ruppert
and Matteson, 2015). They are so-called because they vary fromtimeto
time, but they do not vary across different stocks or financial assets. The
value-minus-growth factor is often called HML, because it is the returns
of a basket of high book-to-market stocks minus that of a basket of low
book-to-market stocks. Such a long-short portfolio whose returns represent
a time-series factor is called a ‘‘hedge’’ portfolio.
## 4
What do vary across
different stocks are their returns in response to this factor. This response
is called thefactor loading(orfactor exposure), which is just a regression
coefficient. Time-series factors usually (but not always) have dimensions of
returns (i.e., dollar divided by time), but factor loadings are dimensionless.
If we think that a stock’s return is driven by multiple factors, we can write
## Return(t,s)−r
## F
## =α(t,s)+훽
## 1
(s)∗Factor
## 1
## (t)+훽
## 2
(s)∗Factor
## 2
## (t)
## +···+ε(t,s)(2.1)
where eachReturn(t,s)represents the return of a stock s over a period from
t−1tot,r
## F
is the risk free rate over the same period, and the훽
i
## (s)are
the factor loadings of that stock. The alphaαof a stock is included, in case
we have some special arbitrage model that tells us why this stock will have
a time-varying return not driven by common factors. In our modeling in
this chapter, we won’t have any such alpha models, henceαwill be set as
a constant in time:α(t,s)=α(s).
## 5
Finally, a noise termεis included to
represent ‘‘white noise.’’ This noisy return is a catchall term that captures
anything that our factor or alpha models are unable to explain, and is
supposed to be uncorrelated both serially (in time) and cross-sectionally
(across stocks). These are the risks that can be diversified away by adding
more stocks to our portfolio.
Since the time-series factors are observable (e.g., we can easily measure
the market return) and known historically, all we need to do is use the
usual least square fit to find the훽
i
(s)’s. But how do we use equation 2.1 for
our investment decisions? Notice that the time indextis the same on both
sides of the equation. This means that this factor model, as with most factor

models you will read about in standard finance textbooks, are descriptive
and explanatory, but not predictive. Theyexplainthe return of a stock that
iscontemporaneouswith the returns of the market index, HML, SMB, and
perhaps other factors. As such, this equation is not immediately useful for
generating trading profits. All we could do is to assume that these factor
returns will remain the same forever, with their future values equal to their
past values, and buy the stocks that have the largestReturn(t,s)and short
the stocks that have the smallest (perhaps negative) returns, according to
equation 2.1. Apart from the effect of random noise, this is essentially
buying the past winners, and shorting the past losers.
Alternatively, we can make things a little more interesting by turning
equation 2.1 into a predictive equation. Just write
## Return(t+1,s)−r
## F
## =α(s)+훽
## 1
(s)∗Factor
## 1
## (t)+훽
## 2
(s)∗Factor
## 2
## (t)
## +···+ε(t,s)(2.2)
and run a similar least square fit. Once we have obtained estimates of the
αand훽
i
for each stock, we can use equation 2.2 for predicting the next
period’s return.
By replacing equation 2.1 with 2.2, I did not mean to imply that a descrip-
tive factor model is useless for traders. Its use, however, is not in predicting
returns—it is in risk management. If, for example, we know that a strategy
or portfolio loads (regresses) positively to volatility change, we might want
to trade another strategy or own another portfolio that loads negatively to
volatility change as a hedge. This does not require us to predict whether
volatility is going up or down, nor does it require us to predict the next
day’s return given today’s volatility change. The two strategies or portfolios
together will have minimum exposure to volatility risk, no matter which
way volatility goes. Much of factor modeling practiced by large funds is not
concerned with predicting returns, but with understanding and managing
the factor risks, and for attributing returns of a strategy to different fac-
tors. Performance attribution is also important because some investors do
not wish to pay incentive (performance-based) fees to the fund managers on
returns that can be attributed to factor returns, since these returns can be
easily obtained by buying smart-beta ETFs or other index funds. However,
the use of factor models for risk management or performance attribution is
not our focus in this chapter.
Besides the market return and HML, other popular time-series factors are
SMB—the returns of a basket of small-market-capitalization stocks minus

that of a basket of big-market-capitalization stocks, and UMD—the returns
of a basket of stocks whose prices went up minus that of a basket of stocks
that went down. (People also call this the WML factor: ‘‘Winners minus
Losers.’’) The latter is, of course, a momentum factor. Interestingly, both
the HML value factor and the UMD momentum factor have positive returns.
As footnoted earlier, HML returned about 900 percent between 1965 and
2011, but UMD returned about 3000 percent over the same period (Ang,
2014)! There is no reason we have to choose one over the other: We can
buy both hedge portfolios simultaneously. Other macroeconomic factors
include economic growth (specifically, real quarterly GDP growth and quar-
terly real personal consumption expenditures growth), quarterly Consumer
Price Index change, and volatility (VIX) change.
We show in Example 2.1 how the market return, HML, and SMB factors
do in predicting daily returns of stocks.
Example 2.1: Using Fama-French factors to predict
the next-day return
The three time-series factors we discussed in the main text, the
excess market return (i.e., market return minus the risk free rate),
the HML portfolio return, and the SMB portfolio return, are called
the Fama–French factors (Fama and French, 1993). They are usually
used as contemporaneous factors to account for the current returns
of a stock. However, here we will see whether they can be used as
predictor factors to predict the next day’s returns of stocks in the S&P
## 500 Index.
For our backtest, we use mid-quotes at market close provided by
the Center for Research of Security Prices (CRSP.com) survivorship-
bias-free database from January 3, 2007, to December 31, 2013. We
choose the midprice (half of the bid and ask prices) at the market close
to represent the closing price in order to avoid effects of the widened
bid-ask spread at the close. The daily market, HML, and SMB fac-
tors are from Professor French’s website mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/
pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html#Research over the same
period as the price data. We divide this data into two halves, and
use the first half as a trainset to estimate the factor loadings for each
stock separately (i.e., in a multivariate, multiple regression).

Since our data set is a survivorship-bias-free one, there are
symbols that stopped trading as well as symbols that just started
trading in the middle of the time period. Hence we can only make
predictions for the subset of dataisGoodDatathat has daily returns on
a certain day.
Naturally, the model works very well in-sample: it has a CAGR of
242 percent and a Sharpe ratio of 3.7. However, it generated nega-
tive returns out-of-sample. Clearly, the Fama-French factors are not
terribly useful for short-term predictions!

■Cross-sectional Factors
Most of us are familiar with the notion that stock-specific factors such as
price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio or gross margin would affect a stock’s return.
These are called cross-sectional factors, because they vary across different
stocks. Actually, it is more accurate to call them factor loadings, in keeping
with our convention that factors usually have dimension of returns and have
the same value across different stocks but varying in time, while factor load-
ings are usually dimensionless and have the same value throughout time but
vary across different stocks.
Time-series factors such as HML and SMB are directly observable as the
returns of a well-defined hedge portfolio, while we have to run a regres-
sion fit to find out the value of the factor loading of each stock. In contrast,
cross-sectional factor loadings such as P/E are obviously observable, and it is
the time-series factors that have to be computed by regressing stock returns
against these factor loadings.
Since practically every item in the financial statement of a company can
be turned into a cross-sectional factor loading for its stock’s return, it is
hard to know what to include. As a start, you may try including everything
you can easily get data on. In Example 2.2, we included 27 fundamental
factor loadings in order to predict the quarterly returns of stocks, and the
out-of-sample performance is quite respectable: the CAGR is 12 percent.
Despite the reasonable performance of applying factor model blindly to all
the fundamental factors available, it is still useful to examine which individ-
ual factor loadings are particularly predictive and perhaps understand why
they are so predictive. This has the benefit of avoiding overfitting to too
many factor loadings, some of which may be just along for the ride. Also,
we should look into innovative factor loadings that are not included in the
financial statements of companies. We will explore these in the following
sections.
Example 2.2: Fitting a cross-sectional factor model to predict
the next-quarter return
We will attempt to use fundamental factor loadings extracted from
the quarterly financial statements of companies to predict their next-
quarter returns. The price data are midprice at market close provided
by CRSP as in Example 2.1. The fundamental data are obtained from

Sharadar’s Core U.S. Fundamentals database and delivered through
Quandl.com. However, we avoid factor loadings that scale with the
size of the company, such as total revenue or market capitalization.
Any dependence of returns on size can be better captured by the
time-series SMB factor instead. There are a total of 27 cross-sectional
factor loadings that are company-size independent. These are listed as
in Table 2.1.

These variables are stored asT×Smatrices, whereTis the number
of historical days in the data, andSis the number of stocks (actually
greater than 500, since we need to include stocks that were histori-
cally in the SPX index but were delisted on or before the last day in the
dataset). We want to predict the returns of these stocks using a factor
model similar to equation 2.2, withα(s)replaced byα(t)since this is
now a cross-sectional model. In principle, fitting such a cross-sectional
model means that at every time (calendar quarter)t,wewillhavea
different set of regression coefficientsFactor
i
(t). But due to the limited
number of data points (about 500 for SPX stocks) at any one time,
this regression won’t be very robust. Furthermore, there is no rea-
son to believe that the factors should change from quarter to quarter
(though of course the factor loadings such as PE ratio do change). To
increase robustness, we will combine all the data throughout the train-
set for many quarters. In programming terms, we combine all the
columns of data belonging to different stocks into one single vector
withT×Srows, using thereshapefunction. Below, we show how to
reshape the dependent variable (quarterly returns from the next day’s
close, which is the first closing price with which we could enter into
positions):
retQ=calculateReturns(mid, holdingDays); % quarterly return
retFut=fwdshift(holdingDays+1, retQ);
trainset=1:floor(length(tday)/2);
Y=reshape(retFut(trainset, :), [length(trainset)*length(syms) 1]);
% dependent variable
We can apply the samereshapefunction to the input factor loadings
(the independent variables) as well. Notice we use only the first half
of the data as train data to fit the regression model. Once the data are
laid out in the proper dimension, we can use thefitlmfunction as in
Example 2.1 for the regression fit:
model=fitlm(X, Y,  'linear')
The beauty of thefitlmfunction is that it will automatically ignore
any rows (days) that contain a NaN value. In our case, this means
that it will only regress on those days for a stock with an earnings
announcement that makes available all the financial variables. So
for each stock, only one day per quarter will actually be used as

input data. This fit produces a very weak model: theR

is only 0.015.
Nevertheless, predictive models in finance often are very weak, but
that doesn’t mean we cannot generate profits. To make predictions,
we need to use thepredictfunction and then unpack the vector
containing the predicted returns back to aT×Smatrix before we can
compute our usual performance measures:
retPred=reshape(predict(model, X), [length(trainset)
length(syms)]);
Our trading strategy uses these predicted quarterly returns by
entering into a long position in a stock on the following trading day’s
market close whenever its predicted return is positive, and holding
for a quarter (or more precisely, 63 trading days), and similarly for
the short positions.
longs=backshift(1, retPred>0); %1 day later
shorts=backshift(1, retPred<0);
longs(1, :)=false;
shorts(1, :)=false;
positions=zeros(size(retPred));
for h=0:holdingDays-1
long_lag=backshift(h, longs);
long_lag(isnan(long_lag))=false;
long_lag=logical(long_lag);
short_lag=backshift(h, shorts);
short_lag(isnan(short_lag))=false;
short_lag=logical(short_lag);
positions(long_lag)=positions(long_lag)+1;
positions(short_lag)=positions(short_lag)-1;
end
Despite the weak regression fit, this strategy generates a CAGR
of 12.3 percent out-of-sample, with a Sharpe ratio of 1.7, and a
maximum drawdown of 7.6 percent. The equity curve is shown on
## Figure 2.1.

You may be curious whether just throwing in the whole lot of fun-
damental factors, including those that scale with company size, will
generate comparable returns. There are 112 such factors in total, and
theR
## 2
on the trainset is greatly improved to 0.961 (even the adjusted
## R
## 2
, which supposedly adjusts for the larger number of factors, is a
very respectable 0.671.) Indeed, the CAGR of the training set is very
high: 48 percent. However, this model fell apart completely on the test
set, generating a negative CAGR. Clearly, the larger number of factors
result in severe overfitting.
■A Two-Factor Model
A paper by Chattopadhyay, Lyle, and Wang (2015) presented an exceedingly
simple cross-sectional two-factor model that is derived from fundamental
financial principles. The two-factor loadings are the log of return-on-equity
(ROE) and the log of book-to-market ratio (BM). ROE is defined as
ROE(i,s)=1+X(i,s)∕Book(i−1,s)

whereX(i,s)is the net income before extraordinary items from the most
recent financial quarterithat has been reported, andBook(i−1,s)is the
book value from the quarter prior to thei
th
## .
We can use these two-factor loadings in the same way as we did in
Example 2.2: Estimate the factors (regression coefficients) on a trainset,
and apply the model to predict the monthly returns of each stock in the test
set. If the predicted return is positive, we buy $1 of the stock and hold for a
month, and vice versa for shorts. We will discuss some of the coding details
in Example 2.3, but the result of this simple strategy on the test set is seem-
ingly very good: the CAGR is 9.3 percent with a Sharpe ratio of 1 from July
2010 to the end of 2013. In fact, as Chattopadhyay, Lyle, and Wang (2015)
asserted, ROE is a more reliable predictor of future returns than BM. If we
use just a one-factor model with ROE, the out-of-sample CAGR is actually
increased to 20.2 percent and the Sharpe ratio to 1.3. The equity curves of
both the one-factor and two-factor models are shown in Figure 2.2.
There is, however, one fly in the ointment: the portfolios generated by
these trading strategies are usually net long. That is, they have more long

than short positions. Since we enjoyed a fabulous bull market from 2010 to
2013, it is no surprise that these strategies produced a good return. If we
use SPY to hedge the net exposure of the portfolio (whether long or the
rare short net exposure), then the out-of-sample CAGR for either one or
two factors is about zero.
There is another way to produce a market neutral portfolio other than
hedging with SPY. On any given day, we can rank the predicted returns, and
long the stocks in the top quintile of predicted returns, and short those in
the bottom quintile (provided that there are five or more stocks that have
earnings announcements in the previous day). Unfortunately, this technique
generates negative returns on the test set for either one or two factors.
There is one reason why our market-neutral results here seem to pale
beside that of Chattopadhyay, Lyle, and Wang (2015), who obtained
out-of-sample CAGR of 4.3 percent for a market-neutral portfolio of US
stocks. They included all stocks in the United States that are in the top
## 98
th
-percentile in market capitalization and liquidity,
## 7
while we included
only large-cap (SPX) stocks. If we apply the ROE one-factor model to
small-cap (SML) stocks only, we generate a CAGR of over 5 percent, which
is a lot closer to the published results. This difference of factor model
performance between large- and small-cap stocks is corroborated by the
research of Kaplan (2014), who found that value factors are useless for
predicting returns of SPX stocks.
Aside from its rigorous theoretical derivation from first principles, the
ROE factor is actually quite similar to the return-on-capital and the earnings
yield factors made popular by the author Joel Greenblatt in hisThe Little Book
That Still Beats the Market(Greenblatt, 2010).
Example 2.3: Fitting the ROE and BM factor model to predict
the next-month return
To validate the results of Chattopadhyay, Lyle, and Wang (2015),
we use the same price and fundamental data set described in
Example 2.2. For the variableX(Net Income before Extraordinary
Items), we use the variable ARQ_EPS (Earnings per Basic Share)
from Sharadar, whereas for the variablebook(book value per share),
we use ARQ_BVPS. To compute ROE, we divide ARQ_EPS of

the most recent quarter by the book value per share of the prior
quarter.
earningsInc=ARQ_EPS; % Earnings (net income) per Basic Share
bvpershr=ARQ_BVPS;
bvpershr_lag=backshift(1, fillMissingData(bvpershr));
ROE=1+earningsInc./bvpershr_lag;
To compute BM, we take the reciprocal of ARQ_PB (price-to-book
ratio):
## BM=1./ARQ_PB;
There are stocks with negative earnings (net income), and there are
even stocks with negative book value. We effectively remove
## 8
such data
from the input by setting them to NaN:
ROE(ROE <= 0)=NaN;
BM(BM <= 0)=NaN;
As in Example 2.2, we need to aggregate data from different stocks
before running our regression fit:
X(:, 1)=reshape(log(BM(trainset, :)), [length(trainset)*
length(syms) 1]);
X(:, 2)=reshape(log(ROE(trainset, :)), [length(trainset)*
length(syms) 1]);
The rest of the code is identical to that in Example 2.2, and it
can be downloaded as twoFundamentalFactors.m. This produces an
out-of-sample CAGR of 9.3 percent.
If we want to test the market-neutral strategy mentioned in the main
text, where we rank the predicted returns, long the stocks in the top
quintile of predicted returns, and short those in the bottom quintile
when there are five or more stocks that have earnings announcements
in the previous day, we can write
[retPredSorted, idx]=sort(retPred, 2);
longs=false(size(retPred));
shorts=longs;

for t=2:size(longs, 1)

## +1:end)))=true;
shorts(t, idx(t-1, idxFinite(1:floor(length

end
end
Once thelongsandshortsarrays are thus determined, the rest of the
code is again the same as in Example 2.2. This produces a CAGR of
−9.2 percent.
■Using Option Prices to Predict Stock Returns
Market folklore has it that options traders are smarter and better informed
than mere stock traders. (One can frequently observe option traders with
lifted chins looking down their noses at stock traders.) Therefore, one would
think that we could predict stock returns using options price information.
This intuition is borne out by a shocking number of academic studies. We
can summarize the predictive options information in the form of factors. For
those readers who may be unfamiliar with options terminology, you can first
read Chapter 5 on options before reading this section.
## 1) Implied Moments
In a paper by Bali, Hu, and Murray (2015), implied volatility is defined
as the average of the at-the-money (ATM) call and put options implied
volatilities, while the implied skewness is measured by the difference
between the out-of-the-money (OTM) calls and puts implied volatilities.
Here, a call or put option is regarded as ATM if it has a delta of about 0.5
or−0.5, respectively, and OTM if it has a delta of about 0.25 or−0.25,
respectively. Finally, implied kurtosis is measured by the difference between
the sum of the implied volatilities of OTM calls and puts versus the sum of
the implied volatilities of ATM calls and puts. We also specify that all these
options should have a ‘‘tenor’’ of 30 days. That is, they all have 30 days

until expiration. (We shall see how we can enforce this requirement in
practice.) In summary,
## Vol=
## CIV(0.5)+PIV(−0.5)
## 2
Skew=CIV(0.25)−PIV(−0.25)
Kurt=CIV(0.25)+PIV(−0.25)−CIV(0.5)−PIV(−0.5)
where CIV and PIV indicate call and put implied volatility respectively, and
the number in the parentheses indicates the delta of the option. Why all
these definitions? The researchers found that the underlying stock’s expected
return is strongly positively related to each of these implied moments.
We can construct a long-short portfolio that has a high expected return by
following this recipe. First, sort the stocks by their implied skewness, take
the top 30 percent, then sort this subset by their implied kurtosis, take the
top 30 percent, then finally sort this sub-subset by their implied volatility,
and again take the top 30 percent. This constitutes the long side of the port-
folio. The short side is similarly constructed, except that we take the bottom
30 percent at each sorting step. We will perform the sorting every month
and hold such a portfolio for a month. This long-short strategy returns an
unlevered 9.68 percent per annum (i.e., if one is long $0.5 million and short
$0.5 million of stocks, one should expect an annual profit of $96,800).
The reason why stocks with high implied volatilities have higher expected
returns basically follows from the well-known dictum: Higher risks have
to be compensated by higher returns. This is just the capital asset pricing
model (CAPM) fondly studied by generations of finance students (Sharpe,
1964). Similarly, investors are averse tokurtosis,which is another word for
tail risks,and thus they also need to be compensated by higher future returns
if such risks are high. When expected risks are high, investors would pay
more to buy options. In particular, they pay relatively more for OTM
options than ATM options when expected tail risks are high. Bali, Hu,
and Murray (2015), explain that stocks with high implied skewness have
higher expected returns because investors with positive expectations about
future returns buy OTM calls and/or sell OTM puts, thereby increasing
the implied skewness.
This research was performed on all US stocks that have listed options
from 1999 to 2012. The researchers used numerical techniques to construct
a volatility surface and to back out the implied volatilities of call and put
options that have the required deltas and tenor of 30 days. In Example 2.4,
we will try this strategy on SPX stocks from 2007 to 2013.

One side note: Is it important that the authors chose tenor of 30 days?
The answer seems to be no. The ratio of implied volatilities as a function of
delta is independent of tenor, according to Sinclair (2016).
Example 2.4: Long (short) stocks with high (low)
implied moments
Instead of applying the strategy described in Bali, Hu, and Murray
(2015) to all US stocks with listed options, we apply it only to SPX
stocks with listed options. As in the original paper, our stock price
data come from CRSP, while options data come from OptionMetrics’
implied volatility surface. Following the paper, we also picked the
implied volatilities of those options that have a tenor of 30 days, and
with a delta of±0.5 for ATM options and±0.25 for OTM options.
These implied volatilities are stored in the arraysimpVolC_ATM(for
calls),impVolP_ATM(for puts),impVolC_OTM,andimpVolP_OTM,
which have the sameT×Sdimension as the closing price arraycl,
whereTis the number of days in the data set, andSis the number
of stocks. Our data runs from January 3, 2007, to December 31,
2013, and there are 743 stock symbols in our survivorship-bias-free
database. To compute the variablesVol,Skew,andKurtas described in
the main text, we go through each day in a for loop, and
impVol=(impVolC_ATM(t, :)+impVolP_ATM(t, :))/2;
impSkew=impVolC_OTM(t, :)-impVolP_OTM(t, :);
impKurtosis=impVolC_OTM(t, :)+impVolP_OTM(t, :)-impVolC_ATM(t, :)
-impVolP_ATM(t, :);
Next,wefirstsortbySkew, taking care to ensure that we choose only
those stocks with finite implied skewness, and take the top 30 percent
as long candidates, and the bottom 30 percent as short candidates:
goodData=find(isfinite(impSkew));
[∼, idx1]=sort(impSkew(goodData), 'ascend');
topPct=0.3;
topN1=round(length(goodData)*topPct);
shortCandidates=goodData(idx1(1:topN1)); % Short low Skew
longCandidates=goodData(idx1(end-topN1+1:end)); % Buy high Skew

Then we sort the long candidates byKurt, again taking the top

[∼, idx2L]=sort(impKurtosis(longCandidates), 'descend');
topN2L=round(length(longCandidates)*topPct);
longCandidates2=longCandidates(idx2L(1:topN2L)); % Buy high

Similarly, we sort the short candidates byKurt, taking the bottom

topN2S=round(length(shortCandidates)*topPct);
shortCandidates2=shortCandidates(idx2S(1:topN2S)); % Short low

Finally, we sort the new long candidates byVol, taking the top
30 percent as the final long candidates:
[∼, idx3L]=sort(impVol(longCandidates2), 'descend');
topN3L=round(length(longCandidates2)*topPct);
longCandidates3=longCandidates2(idx3L(1:topN3L)); % Buy high IV
We similarly sort the new short candidates byVol, taking the bottom
30 percent as the final short candidates:
[∼, idx3S]=sort(impVol(shortCandidates2), 'ascend');
topN3S=round(length(shortCandidates2)*topPct);
shortCandidates3=shortCandidates2(idx3S(1:topN3S)); % Short low IV
Naturally, we will buy the long candidates, short the short candi-
dates, and hold the portfolio for 21 days (1 month).

pos0(t, longCandidates3)=1;
pos=zeros(size(pos0));

Note that instead of only entering into new positions at the begin-
ning of the month, we do this sorting every day, and enter into a new
portfolio every day. So there are a total of 21 portfolios that we hold
simultaneously on each day, and we have to divide the P&L by the total
gross market value of these portfolios to generate the unlevered return
each day.
In contrast to Bali (2015), who obtained a CAGR of 9.68 percent,
we obtain almost exactly zero return. Just like the model discussed in
the section on ‘‘A Two-Factor Model,’’ these factors have no predictive
power on large-cap stocks at all! If you want to implement this trading
strategy, I recommend trying it on all optionable stocks instead.
2) Monthly Change in Implied Volatilities
‘‘Stocks with large increases in call (put) implied volatilities over the previ-
ous month tend to have high (low) future returns. Sorting stocks ranked into
decile portfolios by past call implied volatilities produces spreads in aver-
age returns of approximately 1 percent per month...,’’ so wrote An et al.
(2013). This means we can expect an unlevered CAGR of over 6 percent
from buying those stocks in the top decile of predicted returns and shorting
those in the bottom decile, and hold these for a month before rebalancing.
This may be the most intuitive of all the results in this section: when
option traders expect a stock’s price to increase, they will pay more for a call
option which gives them the right to buy it at a pre-specified price. So this
result just tells us that these option traders are correct in their expectation.
The opposite result, of course, applies to put options.
This research was performed on about 1,000 to 2,300 US stocks from
1996 to 2011. The researchers used numerical techniques to construct a
volatility surface as in Example 2.4 and to back out the implied volatilities
of call and put options that have a delta of 0.5 (i.e., at-the-money, or ATM,
options) with tenor of 30 days.
## 3) Put-call Implied Volatilities
Put-call parity (Sinclair, 2010) is only exactly true for European options,
and small deviation from it is permitted for American options. Cremers
and Weinbaum (2010), found that deviation from put-call parity is useful
for predicting future stock returns. The deviation from put-call parity is

stocks in the top quintile ofVSand short those in the bottom quintile at the
market close on dayt, and hold these for a week before rebalancing, we can
expect an unlevered CAGR of about 12.4 percent.
Why can the difference of call and put prices foretell a stock’s return? The
intuition is simple: if option traders believe stock price will increase, they
would buy calls or short puts. Both actions increase call prices and decrease
put prices, thus increasingVS, and vice versa if they believe stock price would
decrease. Since option traders are on average correct in their predictions, we
can useVSas a factor to predict stock returns.
The research was performed on 1,500 to 2,300 US stocks from 1996 to
2005, and a numerical (binomial tree) technique was again used to back out
the implied volatilities of the options with various strikes and expirations.
However, as with many informative factors, the power of this factor to pre-
dict expected returns has gradually diminished over time. Indeed, the CAGR
in the last three years of this data set became 3.7 percent.
4) OTM Put–ATM Call Implied Volatilities
The difference between OTM put and ATM call implied volatilities is called
the volatility smirk, or the skew, by Zhang, Zhao, and Xing (2008), who
found that stocks in the top quintile of skewunderperform those in the bot-
tom quintile by 16 basis points per week (i.e., the factor isnegativefor this
skew factor loading). So the unlevered CAGR would be 4.2 percent if we
form a short-long portfolio weekly based on sorting on their skew.
The justification of this phenomenon is that informed traders who predict
that a stock will suffer a price drop tend to purchase OTM puts to express
their views, causing these puts to increase in implied volatility, and their pre-
dictions are correct on average. The ATM calls are just used as a benchmark
for implied volatility because they are the most liquid.
Just like all the other options factors, this research was performed on all
listed US stock options from 1996 to 2005, with implied volatilities backed

out by binomial trees as above. A put option with ratio of strike price to the
stock price (this ratio is called ‘‘moneyness’’) lower than 0.95 but higher
than 0.8 is selected as OTM, while a call option is defined as ATM when
the ratio of strike price to the stock price is between 0.95 and 1.05. Only
options with tenor between 10 to 60 days are included, and a weekly skew is
computed by averaging daily skew over a week (from Tuesday close to Tues-
day close). When there are multiple ATM and OTM options for one stock
on one particular day, the researchers further select options by choosing the
call option with moneyness closest to 1, and the put option with moneyness
closest to 0.95.
5) Daily Change in ImpliedMarketVolatility
Instead of using the change in stock return implied volatility as cross-
sectional factors as in (2), Chang (2009), used the daily change in SPX
marketindex option implied volatility as atime-seriesfactor to predict stock
returns. They found that stocks with high sensitivities (factor loadings) to
daily change in impliedmarketvolatility exhibit low returns on average. At
the end of each month, if we buy stocks that are in the lowest quintile of the
factor loading and short those that are in the highest quintile, weighing each
stock by its market value within that quintile and holding the long-short
portfolio for a month, we obtain an unlevered CAGR of 3.6 percent.
The reason stocks that react positively to increase in market volatilities
tend to have lower returns is because they are a good hedge against mar-
ket risk. Investors like such hedges and are willing to pay dearly for them,
causing them to be overpriced and resulting in lower expected return.
The researchers tested this strategy on all listed US stocks from 1996
to 2007, using the VIX index as a proxy for implied volatility of the mar-
ket index. The expected returns, as usual, are lower for the second half
of the data. They have also used daily change in implied market skewness
as another time-series factor, and the analogous strategy is found to have a
higher return. But there are quite a few technical complications in imple-
menting this, so we won’t discuss that here.
■Short Interest
The number of shares of a stock that have been borrowed for shorting
is called the short interest. One may think that short sellers should be
better informed than the average investor, since short sellers are exposed to

Trim Size: 6in x 9inChan  c02.tex  V2 - 12/11/2016  12:44 A.M.  Page 48

## 

## 
theoretically unlimited risk. Therefore, short interest as a cross-sectional
factor loading should have a negative factor with respect to future return.
To test this hypothesis, let’s define short interest ratio (SIR) as the number
of shares borrowed for shorting divided by the total shares outstanding.
## 9
If we sort SPX stocks from January 12, 2007, to December 31, 2013, based
on their daily SIR, and buy the bottom decile (with the lowest SIR) while
short the top decile, and rebalance daily, we actually find that the return is
negative. (If we do the opposite and short the bottom decile and long the top
decile instead, the CAGR is 2.2 percent.) So based on this measure of short
interest, short sellers are actually wrong: The most shorted stocks actually
have positive future returns.
However, SIR is not the only way to capture short interest. We can
also compute a quantity often called days to cover, or DTC, which is the
number of shares borrowed for shorting divided by the average daily trading
volume.
## 10
In our backtest, we use the 20-day moving average as a proxy
for the average daily trading volume. Constructing the long-short portfolio
exactly the same way as above except now using DTC to sort stocks, we
find that the unlevered CAGR over the same period is 5.8 percent, with
the Sharpe ratio a respectable 1.1. So apparently DTC is a better short
interest factor than SIR, and its factor with respect to future returns is
indeed negative (i.e., short sellers are right after all!) Unfortunately, just
as for many of the factors we have discussed so far, the predictive power of
this factor is growing weaker in recent years. In fact, since 2012, the sign
of its factor loading seems to have reversed (Zerohedge, 2014).
■Liquidity
In a famous paper by Ibbotson (2014), it was found that the less liquid a
stock, the higher its future return. The researchers measured liquidity of a
stock as the sum of the 12 monthly trading volumes divided by each month’s
total shares outstanding. They then sorted the top 3,500 largest (by market
cap) stocks by their liquidity and bought the first quartile (the least liquid)
and shorted the fourth quartile. Each stock is allocated equal dollar weight.
This long-short portfolio was rebalanced only once a year to minimize the
potential transactions costs of trading illiquid stocks. This strategy generated
a CAGR of 7.27 percent from 1972 to 2013.
This strategy may be suitable for long-term investors, but for traders with
shorter horizon and who desire higher Sharpe ratio, I investigated a variation

that would rebalance daily. In other words, I computed liquidity daily using
the average of the last 21 days’ trading volume divided by the most recently
reported total shares outstanding. I also limited myself to SPX stocks in order
to minimize the transaction costs that may be incurred by trading smaller
market cap stocks. Finally, instead of buying and shorting the first and fourth
quintile of the liquidity-sorted stocks respectively, we buy and short the 50
least and most liquid stocks. When we ran this backtest from February 1,
2007, to December 31, 2013, we found negative return. Conversely, if we
short the 50 least and buy the 50 most liquid stocks instead, we generated a
CAGR of 8.4 percent. (See Figure 2.3 for the equity curve.) Our result on
SPX stocks is thus completely opposite to that of Ibbotson and Kim (2014)!
■Statistical Factors
Statistical factors are so-called because they are derived purely from the sta-
tistical properties of the stock returns—more specifically, their covariance
matrix. Let’s suppose we want to write a decomposition of a stock’s return
as a time-series factor model as shown in equation 2.1:
## Return(t,s)−r
## F
## =α(t,s)+훽
## 1
(s)∗Factor

But unlike a fundamental time-series model such as the Fama-French
three-factor model discussed in Example 2.1, we have no idea whatFactor

same time, unlike a fundamental cross-sectional model such as the Chat-
topadhyay two-factor model discussed in Example 2.3, we also don’t know
what the factor loadings훽
## 1
## (s),훽
## 2
(s), etc. are. Our statistical factorloadings
are also not directly observable. All we know is that we want to construct
these (time-series) factors such that
- The component of a stock’s returns captured by thei

## Factor

(t), is uncorrelated with that captured by thej

factor; and
- The first (i=1) component of a stock’s returns has the largest variance,
with successively smaller variances asiincreases.
It turns out that if we diagonalize the covariance matrix of the returns,
sort the eigenvectors in descending magnitude of their eigenvalues (which
must be non-negative since any covariance matrix is positive semi-definite),
and use thei

eigenvector as the factor loadings훽
i
(s), then the properties (1)
and (2) are both satisfied. This is just the well-known principal component
analysis, or PCA (Ruppert and Matteson, 2015). Since the factor loadings
are now known, all we have to do is to use linear regression to find theFactor
i
## .
Hence this statistical factor model can be considered a cross-sectional factor
model, which means that actuallyα(t,s)=α(t), as in Example 2.2.
As we discussed before, equation 2.1 (more precisely, its cross-sectional
version reproduced above) is descriptive, not predictive. We need to make
it predictive as in equation 2.2. In order to do that with statistical factors, we
need to first find out what eachFactor
i
is. Fortunately, MATLAB’s Statistics
and Machine Learning Toolbox’spcafunction provides us not only with the
eigenvectors, but also these factors themselves (plus the variances of each
component, which we don’t actually need for predicting returns). Once
the factors are found, we can go back and find out what the
## ̂
## 훽
i
(s)are in
equation 2.2 through linear regression. Note that these
## ̂

(s)of the original covariance matrix anymore!
In Example 2.5, I demonstrate how to apply this to SPX stocks, generating
a CAGR of 15.6 percent with a Sharpe ratio of 1.4 from January 3, 2007, to
December 31, 2013. The equity curve is shown in Figure 2.4. In contrast
to many of the fundamental factor models we described so far, the statistical
factor model actually produced positive returns even for large-cap stocks!
Statistical factors are often more useful than fundamental factors for
short-term, or even intraday, trading. In a short time frame, fundamental

factors do not change at all. Also, statistical factors can be more useful
for trading in markets where fundamental factors are less important for
predictive purposes. An example would be foreign currencies trading.
Example 2.5: Using PCA to findpredictivestatistical factors
As discussed in the main text, finding statistical factors that we can
use for predicting the next day’s return is a two-step process. The first
step is the usual Principal Component Analysis, where the most impor-
tant output to us is not the eigenvectors (i.e., the factor loadings), but
the time-series factors themselves. Assume that we want the top five
factors (the five factors that generate the largest variances), and that
we use one year (252 days) of SPX stocks’ daily returns data to con-
struct the covariance matrix. These parameters,numFactors=5, and
lookback=252, can, of course, be optimized in-sample, though we
picked them arbitrarily. In order to apply the MATLAB Statistical and
Machine Learning Toolbox’spcafunction to these returns, we need to
eliminate any stocks that haveNaNreturns in the lookback period (i.e.,
stocks that have been listed or delisted in the middle of this period).
This is similar to the data cleansing procedure used in Example 2.1, as

Trim Size: 6in x 9inChan  c02.tex  V2 - 12/11/2016  12:44 A.M.  Page 52
## MACHINE TRADING
## 

we are using the same price database from CRSP. Assuming the daily
returns were stored in aT×Smatrixret1,andtrainsetis the index array
of the data in the lookback period that ends with dayt, the following
code fragment will take care of this cleansing:
trainset=t-lookback+1:t;
## R=ret1(trainset, :);
hasData=find(all(isfinite(R), 1));
R=R(:, hasData);
Typically, we will have more than 300 stocks left at any time during
the period of the data (which runs from January 3, 2007, to December
## 31, 2013).
Once eliminated, we can write
[factorLoadings, factors, factorVariances] = pca(R, 'Algorithm',
'eig', 'NumComponents', numFactors);
If you are curious, you can examine the first column of the
factorLoadingsmatrix, which corresponds to the eigenvector of the
largest eigenvalue. You will see that all the values of this eigenvector
are positive. The reason is that the first statistical (time-series) factor
we have found is essentially the market return as in the Fama-French
three-factor model, and there is no SPX stock that has a propensity
to move in the opposite direction to the market (i.e., no stock has
negative beta).
Though it is instructive to look at the factor loadings of this descrip-
tive (contemporaneous) factor model, we don’t actually have any use
for them. We need to find the factor loadings for a predictive factor
model. To do this, we regress the next day’s returns against the fac-
tors that we have computed. To ensure that we only use data on or
before daytwithin the lookback period in order to avoid look-ahead
bias, we will only regress the future returns up to the second last day of
the trainset. Just as in Example 2.1, we have to do this for each stock
separately, in a multivariate, multiple linear regression:
for s=1:length(hasData)
model=fitlm(factors(1:end-1, :), retFut1(trainset(1:end-1),
hasData(s)), 'linear');
retPred1(1, hasData(s))=predict(model, factors(end, :));
end

## FACTOR MODELS

In the second line of the for-loop, we have also applied the fitted
linear model to the factor of the last day of the trainset to predict the
return for the following day. It is important to note that this last day
wasn’t used in the regression fit.
Finally, we will sort the predicted returns in ascending order, and
buy $1 of each stock within the 50 highest predicted returns, and short
$1 of each stock in the 50 lowest predicted returns.
isGoodData=find(isfinite(retPred1));
[∼, I]=sort(retPred1(isGoodData)); % ascending sort
positions(t, isGoodData(I(1:topN)))=-1;
positions(t, isGoodData(I(end-topN+1:end)))=1;
Of course,topN=50 is another parameter that can be optimized
in-sample. This strategy generates a CAGR of 15.6 percent. The com-
plete code can be downloaded as StatisticalFactors_predictive.m.
■Putting Them All Together
One of the nice features of factor models is that we are not limited to this or
that factor—we can put all the factors mentioned in this chapter together
and use them in one predictive regression model. Of course, this is subject
to the condition that none of these factors are collinear, and I am sure some
of our factors are. But this is a minor technical snafu: a standard cure to
collinearity is to systematically reduce the factors one by one based on the
AIC or BIC criteria (Ruppert and Matteson, 2015). We will talk about that
in the context of stepwise regression in Chapter 5.
While a regression model is often necessary to find out the factor load-
ing(s) applicable to a specific stock, it is not necessary for predicting future
returns. For example, as long as we are certain that stocks with higher ROE
will have higher future return (see the section on ‘‘A Two-Factor Model’’),
we don’t necessarily need to know the regression coefficient at a particular
time (a time-series factor in this case) in order to construct a trading
model. We merely need to rank the stocks based on their ROE and buy
the top quantile while short the bottom one. This ranking methodology is
simple and powerful: It often gives us a better trading model than using the
precise predicted return of a regression model. The reason is that an outlier
data point can easily bias the regression coefficients and thus the predicted
returns. (These outliers are called ‘‘high-leverage points’’ in regression

literature.) However, the ranking methodology is immune to such outliers.
This is reminiscent of the situation with computing correlation coefficients.
When two time series contain outlier data points, the estimate of corre-
lation coefficient can be distorted. There, the usual remedy is to compute
Spearman rank correlation instead of the usual Pearson correlation,
analogous to ranking the factor loadings to determine trading signals.
When there are more than one-factor loadings, simple ranking or sort-
ing becomes multisorting, just as univariate regression becomes multiple
regression. We have seen this in action already with the implied volatility/
skewness/kurtosis factor in the section ‘‘Using Option Prices to Predict
Stock Returns.’’ We just pick one-factor loading at a time to sort the stocks,
pick the top and bottom quantiles, and sort those stocks within each of those
quantiles with the next factor loading, and so on. Ultimately, we will only
long the stocks in the top quantile of the last factor within the top quantile
of the second last factor within the top quantile of the third last factor and so
on, while we will short the opposite. Typically, we start sorting with the fac-
tor loading with the strongest predictive power, and then go down the list.
The trading strategy does depend on the order of factor loadings we pick,
and often, we may not know which factor loading has the strongest predic-
tive power until we try them in a backtest. Of course, all these experiments
and optimizations should be done in the trainset!
There is one other nuance when implementing a predictive factor model
using the multi-sort method. The sign of the factor may very well depend on
what universe of stocks we are applying the model to. For example, the liq-
uidity factor we discussed earlier was found to have a negative factor for the
top 3,500 stocks by Ibbotson (2014), but we found that the factor is positive
for SPX stocks. The sign of a factor may also depend on the industry group to
which a stock belongs. Hence, a more sophisticated version of the multisort
algorithm might perform the sort only within a group (based on market
cap, or industry group, or whether they are growth or value stocks,...).
This method is essentially sorting the stocks based on a time-series factor
first (e.g., HML, industry group, SMB), before applying the cross-sectional
factors (e.g., ROE, BM, liquidity) to each sorted quantile. This will result
in a portfolio that is not only market neutral, but neutral to each of the time
series factors we used for the groupings. (By being neutral to some factor,
we ensure that the portfolio is unaffected by its associated risks.)
You might also wonder why we restrict ourselves to linear regression
models when combining the factor loadings. In fact, we don’t have to. But
applying a nonlinear model to factor loadings is best left to Chapter 5 on

Artificial Intelligence techniques, where nonlinearity is the rule rather than
the exception.
If you find it tiring to research and combine all these factors in an
optimal way in order to predict stock returns, there are websites that will
do it for you. For example, www.magicformulainvesting.com implements
the simple two-factor model of Joel Greenblatt (Greenblatt, 2010), and
www.Factorwave.com implements factor models created by options guru
Euan Sinclair. Not surprisingly, the latter includes many factors derived
from options prices.
■Summary
Factor model is a central concept in modern investment finance. It is
important for understanding what kind of systematic (as opposed to
diversifiable idiosyncratic) risks a portfolio is subject to. Some of us are
willing to take such risks (for example, the long-only investor is willing to
take market risk), while others want to avoid them. However, our focus
here is not risk management, but to predict returns based on specific
factors. These factors may be time-series factors such as the market excess
return, HML, SMB, UMD, the Daily Change in Implied Market Volatility,
or even the unobservable statistical factors. Or they may be cross-sectional
factor loadings such as log(ROE), log(BM), Implied Moments, Change in
Implied Volatility, Call Minus Put Implied Volatility, Volatility Smirk/Skew,
Short Interest, or Liquidity of a stock. Of course, we haven’t cataloged
all possible predictive factors in this chapter, and in fact we left out some
factors that we discussed in Chan (2013), such as the mutual-funds-induced
pressure, and news sentiment.

Investors like factors because, unlike pure arbitrage, factor returns are not
easily arbitraged away because they come with well-defined undiversifiable
risks. Factor models also typically have much larger capacity than arbitrage
models, since many factors do not change rapidly, making them suitable for
longer holding periods. Nevertheless, some factor returns do diminish over
time, mainly because their associated risks diminish over time. Examples of
such factors would include SMB, Call Minus Put Implied Volatility, Daily
Change in Implied Market Volatility, and the DTC Short Interest. Another
limitation of some factors is that they do not work well on large cap stocks.
For example, applying the log(ROE) and log(BM) two-factor model on large
cap stocks result in returns indistinguishable from zero. The same holds for

the Implied Moments factor. The problem with applying factor models to
stocks outside of the large cap universe is of course that transaction costs
are likely to be higher, so we must greet those reports of high returns with
some skepticism. We are pleased to find, however, that some factor returns,
such as that of liquidity, remain significant in recent times and are applicable
to large-cap stocks. This last happy category includes the statistical factors,

■Exercises
2.1. In Example 2.1, use a moving lookback window of 252 days instead
of the static first half of the data as trainset for the regression estimate
of the factor loadings. Does this improve the out-of-sample return of
the model?
2.2. Compute the UMD factor yourself by creating a long-short hedge
portfolio of SPX stocks that went up versus those that went down in
the last 252 days. Add this as the fourth factor in Example 2.1. Does
this improve the out-of-sample return?
2.3. In Example 2.1, use the factors to regress against monthly or quar-
terly instead of daily returns, and use the predictive factor loadings
for a trading model that holds each position for a month (21 days)
or a quarter (63 days). Do these changes improve the out-of-sample
return? Also try this with the UMD factor you constructed in
## Exercise 2.2.
2.4. In Example 2.2, let the factor for each stock take different value every
quarter. Does this improve the out-of-sample return of the model?
Also, try to aggregate the returns of stocks within the same indus-
try group, enforcing the same value for factors only within the same
group.
2.5. In Example 2.2, what is the net exposure (net long-short market value
divided by the gross long+short market value) of the strategy? If this
net exposure is significant, adopt the two methods suggested in the
Two-Factor Model section to turn the portfolio into a market-neutral
one, and see how that affects the returns.
2.6. Modify twoFundamentalFactors.m to use only the ROE factor. Check
that you get out-of-sample CAGR of 20 percent.
2.7. Modify twoFundamentalFactors.m so that the net exposure is hedged
with SPY. Check that you get out-of-sample CAGR of 0 percent.

search for ‘‘total shares outstanding’’), backtest the liquidity factor
from 2007 to the end of 2013, and verify that you obtain a CAGR of
about 8.4 percent.
2.10. Statistical factors are often more useful for intraday trading in markets
that have few fundamental predictive factors. FX trading is one such
example. Apply the code in Example 2.5 to intraday FX trading and
see if you obtain good returns. Free intraday FX historical data are
available from ratedata.gaincapital.com.
2.11. Try different numbers of statistical factors and different lookbacks in
Example 2.5. Are five factors the optimal? Is a lookback of 252 days
optimal?
2.12. In many of the example strategies discussed, we assume that we will
invest an equal dollar amount to every stock that has a long or short
signal. But we can instead invest a dollar amount proportional to the
predicted return. Try this methodology to some of the examples and
see if this improves returns and/or Sharpe ratio.

essentially many independent multiple regressions run separately.

## CHAPTER 3
Time-Series
## Analysis
## E
conomists and electrical engineers have long been trying to predict the
next signal in a time series, which is exactly what traders try to do as
well. This chapter is an introduction to the tools well known in econometrics
and signal processing, and which have found wide acceptance in the quanti-
tative investment community.
You may already have seen some time-series analysis techniques in action
in my previous books (Chan, 2009 and 2013), as a way to test for stationarity
or cointegration of price series. But these are just parts of a general package
of linear modeling techniques with acronyms like ARIMA, VAR, or VEC.
Likewise, almost every technical trader has tried moving averages as a way to
filter out the noise in price series. But have they tried many of the advanced
signal processing filters such as the Kalman filter?
Time-series techniques are most useful in markets where fundamental
information and intuition are either lacking or not particularly useful for
short-term predictions. Currencies and bitcoins fit this bill. Professor Lyons
(2001) wrote that ‘‘...the proportion of monthly exchange rate changes
our textbook models can explain is essentially zero.’’ We will mention a few
examples of using time-series techniques to predict currency returns in this
chapter, and leave the bitcoin examples to Chapter 7. But just as technical
analysis can be useful for stock trading despite the abundance of fundamental
information there, we will describe examples where time-series analysis can
be applied to stocks.
Unlike other books on time-series analysis, we will not be discussing the
inner workings of these techniques, but focus solely on how we can use

ready-made software packages to make predictions. Most of the examples
are implemented using the MATLAB Econometrics Toolbox, butRusers can
find similar functions in the forecast, vars, and dlm packages.
■AR(p)
The simplest model in time-series analysis is AR(1). It is just a linear regres-
sion model that relates the price in one bar to the next:
Y(t)−μ=φ(Y(t−1)−μ)+ε(t)(3.1)
whereY(t)is the price at timet,φis the (auto)regression coefficient, and
εis Gaussian noise with zero mean, sometimes called innovation. Hence,
the nameauto-regressiveprocess. A time series is called weakly
## 1
stationary
if its mean and variance are constant in time, and AR(1) is weakly station-
ary if|φ|<1 (the proof is left as an exercise). A weakly stationary time
series is also mean reverting (Chan, 2013). If|φ|>1, the time series will
trend. Ifφ=1, we have a random walk. To estimateφ, we use thearima
andestimatefunctions in the Econometrics Toolbox.
model_ar1=arima(1, 0, 0) % assumes an AR(1) with unknown parameters
model_ar1_estimates=estimate(model_ar1, cl);
The functionarima(p,d,q)reduces to an AR(1) model if we setp=1
andd=0 (We will discuss the more general version in the next section.)
Theestimatefunction just applies maximum likelihood estimation to find the
parameters for the AR(1) model based on the input price series. Apply-
ing it to the one-minute midprice bars of AUD.USD from July 24, 2007 to
August 3 2015 returns an estimate ofφ=0.99997, with a standard error
of 0.00001.
## 2
We conclude that though AUD.USD is very weakly stationary,
it is very close to a random walk. Note that we tested on midprices instead
of trade prices to reduce bid–ask bounce, which tends to produce phantom
mean-reversion that cannot really be traded on.
Generalizing slightly from AR(1), we can consider AR(p), represented by
## Y(t)=μ+φ
## 1
## Y(t−1)+φ
## 2
## Y(t−2)+···+φ
p
## Y(t−p)+ε(t). (3.2)
You can see that this is just a multiple regression model with the price
at timetas the dependent (response) variable and past prices up to a lag of
pbars as independent (predictor) variables. But introducingpas an additional
parameter means that we can find the optimalpthat gives the best fit of the
AR(p)model to our data. As in many statistical models, we will use the

Bayesian information criterion (BIC) that is proportional to the negative log
likelihood of the model but with an additional term that is proportional to
p, which penalizes complexity. Our objective is to minimize BIC, and we do
this by a brute-force exhaustive search:
## 3
LOGL=zeros(60, 1); % log likelihood for up to 60 lags (1 hour)
P=zeros(size(LOGL)); % p values
for p=1:length(P)
model=arima(p, 0, 0);
[∼,∼,logL] = estimate(model, mid(trainset),'print',false);
LOGL(p) = logL;
P(p) = p;
end
% Has P+1 parameters, including constant
[∼, bic]=aicbic(LOGL, P+1, length(mid(trainset)));
[∼, pMin]=min(bic)
model=arima(pMin, 0, 0) % assumes an AR(pMin) with unknown
parameters

function to it to find the coefficientsμ,φ

Applying these functions to AUD.USD on one-minute midprice bars from
July 24, 2007, to August 12, 2014, yieldsp=10 as the optimal value, with
the coefficients noted in Table 3.1.
We can now use this AR(10) model for prediction on the out-of-sample
data set from August 12, 2014, to August 3, 2015.

execution program that manages limit orders is necessary.
■ARMA(p,q)
From our application of AR(p)to AUD.USD, we see that the best fit requires
10 lags. This high number of lags is quite common for AR(p)models: They
are trying to compensate for the simplicity of the model structure with
a larger number of terms. A small extension of the AR model to include
qlagged noise terms will often reduce the number of lags necessary. This is
called the ARMA(p,q) model, or an auto-regressive moving average process,
where theqlagged noise terms are described as amoving average:
## Y(t)=μ+φ
## 1
## Y(t−1)+φ
## 2
## Y(t−2)+···+φ
p
## Y(t−p)+ε(t)
## +θ
## 1
ε(t−1)+···+θ
q
ε(t−q)(3.3)
Finding the best values of thepandqand the coefficient of each term in
equation 3.3 is similar to the procedure we took for AR(p), but because
we are now doing exhaustive search over two variables, we need nested
for-loops:
LOGL=-Inf(10, 9); % log likelihood for up to 10 p and 9 q
(10 minutes)
PQ=zeros(size(LOGL)); % p and q values
for p=1:size(PQ, 1)
for q=1:size(PQ, 2)
model=arima(p, 0, q);
[∼,∼,logL] = estimate(model, mid(trainset),'print',false);
LOGL(p, q) = logL;
PQ(p, q) = p+q;
end
end
For eachpandq, we save the log likelihood inLOGL(p,q),andp+qin
PQ(p,q), the latter because it is used as a penalty term when minimizing
BIC. How do we identify the optimalpandqthat minimizes BIC from the
LOGLandPQmatrices? We have to turn them into one-dimensional vectors,
apply theaicbicfunction, and then use theminfunction:
% Has p+q+1 parameters, including constant
LOGL_vector = reshape(LOGL, size(LOGL, 1)*size(LOGL, 2), 1);
PQ_vector = reshape(PQ, size(LOGL, 1)*size(LOGL, 2), 1);

[∼, bic]=aicbic(LOGL_vector, PQ_vector+1, length(mid(trainset)));
[bicMin, pMin]=min(bic)
Finally, we have to turn the one-dimensional BIC vector back into a
two-dimensional array, but with only the cell corresponding to the minimum
value populated, in order to facilitate easy visual identification of the row
(corresponding top) and column (corresponding toq) numbers of that cell:
bic(:)=NaN;
bic(pMin)=bicMin;
bic=reshape(bic,size(LOGL))
All these procedures are contained in the programbuildARMA_findPQ_

where we easily determine that the cell with the minimum BIC corresponds
top=2andq=5. These are indeed shorter lags than thep=10 we used
in the AR(p) model. Plugging in these values to thearimafunction and then
applying theestimatefunction on the ARMA(2, 5) model as we did in the
section on AR(p) yields the coefficients shown in Table 3.2.

|is now definitely smaller than 1, indicating
strong mean reversion. However, using theforecastfunctions to generate
trading signals as before actually decreases the out-of-sample annualized
return from 158 percent to 60 percent. The added complexity of using
moving average has not paid off in this case. The equity curve is shown in
Figure 3.2. The backtest program is available as buildARMA_AUDUSD.m.
You may wonder why the function we used for the AR(p)and ARMA
(p,q) models are calledarima. You may also wonder why we focus on pre-
dicting prices rather than returns. The answer to both questions can be
understood by studying the ARIMA(p,d,q) model.

ARMA(2, 5) model on AUD.USD
FIGURE 3.2ARMA(2, 5) trading strategy applied to AUD.USD
ARIMA(p,d,q) stands for autoregressiveintegratedmoving average. Let’s
just concern ourselves withd=1, the simplest and the most common case
in finance. IfY(t)is an ARIMA(p,1,q) model, it implies thatΔY(t)is
an ARMA(p,q), whereΔY(t)=Y(t)−Y(t−1). We can understand this
even better ifY(t)represents log price instead of price. If this is the case, then
using ARMA(p,q) to model the log returns is equivalent to using ARIMA
(p,1,q) to model the log prices.
Would it be advantageous to model log returnsΔYinstead ofYusing
ARMA(p,q)? It would be, if we can further reduce the lagspandqfrom
the ones obtained when modeling prices (or log prices) using ARMA(p,q).
Unfortunately, I have never found that to be true. For example, modeling the
log of AUD.USD time series using ARIMA(p,1,q) givesp=1, andq=9.
The equivalence of an ARIMA(p,1,q) model on log prices to an
ARIMA(p,0,q) model on log returns should not be confused with the
statement that an ARMA(p,q)=ARIMA(p,0,q) model on log prices
is equivalent to some ARMA(p
## ′
## ,q
## ′
)model on log returns. The latter
statement is false. An ARMA model inΔY’s can always be transformed
into an ARMA model inY’s. But an ARMA model forYcannot always be
transformed into an ARMA model forΔY. This is because an ARMA model
forΔYcan only haveΔYas independent variables, whereas an ARMA
model forYcanhavebothΔY(which is just the difference of twoYs) and

Yas independent variables. Hence, a model forYis more flexible and gives
better results. If we want to have a model forΔYthat has bothΔYsandYs
as independent variables, we have to use a VEC(p) model, to be discussed
at the end of the next section on VAR(p).
■VAR(p)
The simple autoregressive model AR(p)inequation3.2canbeeasilygen-
eralized tommultivariate time series. This generalized model is called a
vector autoregressivemodel, or VAR(p). All we need to do is to interpret the
autoregressive coefficientsφasm×mmatrices, and allow the noisesε(t),
which arem-vectors to have nonzero cross-sectional correlations but zero
serial correlations. This means thatε
i
(t)is not correlated withε
j
(s), for any
t≠s,butε
i
(t)could be correlated withε
j
(t). Since the autogressive coef-
ficient matrices relate the current price of every time series to the lagged
prices of all time series, VAR model is particularly suitable for modeling
financial instruments that have correlated returns, such as a portfolio of
stocks within the same industry group. We will focus on the computer hard-
ware group within the S&P 500 Index on January 3, 2007, which consists
of the tickers AAPL, EMC, HPQ, NTAP, and SNDK. To eliminate spuri-
ous mean-reversion effects due to bid-ask bounce, we will use midprices at
market close provided by the Center for Research of Security Prices (CRSP)
from January 3, 2007, to December 31, 2013.
As in the section on AR(p), we first need to determine the optimal lagp.
We will use the first six years of data as training set for this determination.
There are only minor differences in the codes required:
## 4
for p=1:length(P)
model=vgxset('n', size(mid, 2), 'nAR', p, 'Constant', true);
% with additive offset
[model,EstStdErrors,logL,W] = vgxvarx(model,mid(trainset, :));
[NumParam,∼] = vgxcount(model);
LOGL(p) = logL;
P(p) = NumParam;
end
It is gratifying that we findp=1 minimizes BIC (simpler models are usu-
ally better), and this is a typical result for most industry groups. Once this
is decided, the other parameters of the model can be determined by the
functionvgxvarx, which is the equivalent of theestimatefunction for ARIMA

models. Using the same training set, the constant offsets, autoregressive
coefficients, and the covariance of the noise terms are noted in Table 3.3.
(In this table, in contrast to Table 3.1 or 3.2, the subscripts refer to the stocks
instead of number of time lags.)
To make predictions using this model on the out-of-sample data in 2013,
use thevgxpredfunction, which is similar to theforecastfunction for ARIMA.
pMin=1;
yF=NaN(size(mid));
for t=testset(1):size(mid, 1)
FY = vgxpred(model,1, [], mid(t-pMin+1:t, :));
yF(t, :)=FY;
end
In keeping with the linearity of the VAR models, we can construct
a linear trading model as well. Furthermore, we can choose to make it

This trading model yields an annualized return of 48 percent, with a
Sharpe ratio of 0.9. See Figure 3.3 for its equity curve.
We often want to predict changes in priceΔYinstead of priceYitself. So
it is a bit awkward to use the VAR models, and the resulting AR coefficients
do not make too much intuitive sense. Fortunately, VAR(p) can be trans-
formed to a model withΔYas the dependent variable, and various lagged
ΔY’s andY’s as the independent variables. This is called the VEC(q) (vector
error correction) model, and is written as
ΔY(t)=M+CY(t−1)+A
## 1
ΔY(t−1)+···+A

ΔY(t−k)+ε(t).
## (3.5)
Them×mmatrixCin equation 3.5 is called the error correction matrix.
To transform the coefficients of VAR(p)toVEC(q), first note thatq=p−1,
and we can use the functionvartovec. Applying this to the VAR model built
above for computer hardware stocks:
## [model_vec, C]=vartovec(model);

Equation 3.5 is the same as equation 2.7 in Chan (2013), where it was
discussed in connection with the Johansen test for cointegration. Indeed,
if the portfolio of computer hardware stocks were cointegrating,Cwould
give rise to a significantly negative eigenvalue in the Johansen test. But we
do not need a cointegrating portfolio to use VEC(q) for prediction. Some of
the stocks could be trending while others are mean reverting, as we saw in

By the way, if you want to try VAR models on the entire SPX universe
instead of just the computer hardware stocks, make sure your computer has
an unusually large memory! Also, as mentioned before, these models may
behave better if we use log prices instead of prices. (In any case, a log price
representation will allow a better connection to the continuous version of
VAR and VEC. See Cartea, Jaimungal, and Penalva, 2015, p. 285.)
■State Space Models
The AR, ARMA, VAR, and VEC models we have considered so far all use
observable variables (prices of various lags) to predict their future values.
However, econometricians have also concocted a class of models with hidden
variables, calledstates,which can determine the values of observed variables
(though subject to observation noise). These models are calledstate space
models(SSM), a linear example of which is the Kalman filter, discussed in
Chapter 3 of Chan (2013) and used in Chapter 5 in this book. Though there
can be nonlinear state space models, we will discuss only the linear version
in this section.
A state space model starts with a linear relationship that specifies the
time-evolution of the hidden state variable, usually denoted byx:
x(t)=A(t)∗x(t−1)+B(t)∗u(t)(3.6)
wherexis anm-dimensional vector,A(t)andB(t)are possibly time-
dependent but observable matrices (Aism×m, whileBism×k), andu(t)
isk-dimensional Gaussian white noise with zero mean, unit variances, and
zero serial and cross correlations. Equation 3.6 is often called thestate
transitionequation. The observable variables (also calledmeasurements)are
related to the hidden variables by another linear equation
y(t)=C(t)∗x(t)+D(t)∗ε(t)(3.7)
whereyis ann-vector,C(t)andD(t)are possibly time-dependent but
observable matrices (Cisn×m, whileDisn×h), andε(t)ish-dimensional
Gaussian white noise, also with zero mean, unit variances, and zero serial
and cross correlations. Equation 3.7 is often called themeasurement equation.
What are these hidden variables, and why do we want to hypothesize their
existence? An example of a hidden variable is the familiar moving average.
Though we usually compute a moving average of prices using a fixed number

## 
of lagged prices and thus making it apparently an observable variable, we can
argue that this fixed number of lags is an artificial construction. Also, why
not use exponential moving average instead of moving average? The fact that
no one can agree on a standard, uniquemoving averagevariable suggests that
it may be treated as a hidden variable. We can give some structure to this
hidden variablexby requiring that it evolves in a particularly simple way:
x(t)=x(t−1)+B∗u(t)(3.8)
We have assumedA(t)is the identity matrix, which is of course invariant
in time, andBis an unknown but also time-invariant matrix that determines
the covariance of the estimation errors for the moving averagex. (Remember
thatuitself has a covariance matrix that is the identity matrix.) Though we
had said thatBis supposed to be observable, it can be treated as an unknown
parameter(s) to be estimated by applying maximum likelihood estimation
on training data. (In other words,Bis ‘‘observable’’ only to the extent that
its values are not updated at each time step during Kalman filter updates.)
Given the moving average (plural if the time series is multivariate) of a
time series, a trader may hypothesize that the prices aretrending,and thus
the best guess for the observed price at timetis just the estimated moving
average at timetas well:
y(t)=x(t)+D∗ε(t)(3.9)
whereDis another unknown and time-invariant matrix to be estimated
by MLE.
Let’s see this ‘‘moving average’’ model of equations 3.8 and 3.9 in action
by applying it to the same computer hardware stocks’ price series we studied
in the section on VAR(p). We will assume that there are as many hidden state
variables (five in total) as there are stocks in the computer hardware industry
group. This is what a typical moving average model assumes as well—each
price series has its own independent moving average. Furthermore, we
assume also that the state noise of one moving average is uncorrelated
with any other but each may have a different variance. Hence,Bis a 5×5
diagonal matrix with unknown parameters. (Unknown parameters are
denoted as NaN as an input to the MATLABestimatefunction.) Similarly,
we will assume the measurement noise of one stock’s price is uncorrelated
with another, but each may also have a different variance. Hence,Dis also

a5×5 diagonal matrix with unkown parameters. We could have relaxed
this zero-correlation constraint for the state and measurement noises, but
this will mean many more variables to estimate, vastly increasing the time
it takes for optimization and the danger of overfitting.
The code fragment for using theestimatefunction
## 6
to generate an esti-
mate of the unknown variances of the state and measurement noises (the
parameters inBandD) are as follows:
A=eye(size(y, 2)); % State transition matrix
B=diag(NaN(size(y, 2), 1))
C=eye(size(y, 2)); % Time-invariant measurement matrix
D=diag(NaN(size(y, 2), 1))
model=ssm(A, B, C, D);
param0=randn(2*size(B, 1)̂2, 1); % 50 unknown parameters per bar.
model=estimate(model, y(trainset, :), param0);
which generates the values shown in Table 3.5.
In this case, the signs of the diagonal elements of theBandDmatrices
are immaterial, given that the noisesu(t)andε(t)are distributed symmetri-
cally around a zero mean with no cross-correlations. One may also consider
applying SSM on log prices instead, so that the Gaussian noise assumption is
more reasonable.

Once the state transition and measurement equations are fixed, we can
use thefilterfunction to generate predictions of both the state and observa-
tion values.
[x, logL, output]=filter(model, y);
Thex(t)variable in the output of thefilterfunction is the filtered price
(moving average) at timetgiven observed prices up to timet. This model
generates filtered prices that resemble the observed prices very closely, usu-
ally with less than 0.1 percent difference. Given equations (3.8) and (3.9),
this also means that our prediction for next day’s prices will also closely
resemble today’s prices. These predicted prices attgiven observed prices
can be extracted fromoutput(t).ForecastedObs:
for t=1:length(output)
yF(t, :)=output(t).ForecastedObs';
end
where we assign the predicted price for timettoyF(t−1), using the same
convention as we did previously. From these predicted prices, we can calcu-
late the predicted returns
retF=(yF-y)./y;
Note thatretF(t)is the predicted return fromt−1tot, given the
observed priceyat timet−1. These predicted returns can be used in the
same way as we did in the VAR model to create a sector-neutral trading
strategy. We display in Figure 3.4 the cumulative returns of the model on
the trainset, and Figure 3.5 displays the cumulative returns on the test set.
The degree of overfitting is surprising, given that we merely use the training
data to estimate the variances of the state and measurement noises.
Finding the moving average is not the only way the Kalman filter can be
used to predict prices. If we assume trending behavior, we can also use it to
find theslopeof the recent trend in prices, leading to a prediction of the next
price assuming the slope persists. This is left as an exercise for the reader.
Using the Kalman filter to make predictions on observations is not the
only way to apply it to trading. Estimates of the hidden state itself may be
useful—after all, it is supposed to be a moving average. Finding estimates of a
hidden variable in the presence of noise is the original meaning offilteringand
is a well-known concept in signal processing. Besides the Kalman filter, other
well-known filters in finance and economics include the Hodrick-Prescott
filter and the wavelet filter.

Another application of Kalman filtering has been discussed in Chan
(2013), where it was used to find the best estimates of the hedge ratio
between two cointegrated price series. The example given there is the price
series of the ETFs EWA (aT×1 vector) and EWC (also aT×1 vector),
which are supposed to be related as
## [EWC]=[EWA,1]∗
## [
hedge ratio
offset
## ]
## +noise
But instead of treating the two price series as measurements, we
treat EWC as the measurementsy, and EWA augmented with 1s as the
time-varying matrixC(t)in equation 3.7. (The 1s are necessary to allow for
the constant offset in the linear regression relationship between EWA and
EWC.) We treat the hedge ratio and the constant offset between them as
the hidden statex. Hence, we have
x(t)=x(t−1)+B∗u(t)(3.10)
y(t)=C(t)∗x(t)+D∗ε(t)(3.11)
wherexis a 2×1 time-varying vector[hedge ratio,offset]
## ′
,yis a scalar
[EWC(t)], andC(t)is a time-varying 1×2matrix[EWA(t),1]. The MATLAB
code fragments for these specifications are

idxA=find(strcmp('EWA', syms));

## A=eye(2);
B=NaN(2);
C=mat2cell(C, ones(size(cl, 1), 1));

where the NaNs indicate unknown parameters. As before, these unknown
parameters are estimated by applying theestimatefunction

and theBmatrix is displayed in Table 3.6, and the scalarDis estimated as
−0.08. Unlike Table 3.5, we do not impose the constraint that the state
noise has zero cross-correlations.

We can see that the equity curve has started to flatten even during the latter
part of the trainset. This could have been a result of regime change, where
EWA and EWC have fallen out of cointegration, or more likely, a result of
overfitting the noise covariance matrixB.
■Summary
Time-series analysis is the first technique one should try when confronted
with a brand-new financial instrument or market, and we have not yet
developed any intuition about it. We have surveyed some of the most
popular linear models of time series that have found their way into many
quantitative traders’ strategies. Despite their linearity, there are often many
parameters that need to be estimated, and so overfitting is a constant danger.
This is especially true for state space models, where there is an extra hidden
variable with its own dynamics that need to be estimated. A successful
application of these methods to strategy building will involve imposing
judicious constraints to reduce the number of unknown parameters.
A popular constraint in the case of the ARMA or VAR models would be to
limit the number of lags to 1, and in the case of the SSM, the assumption of
zero cross correlations for the noises. Beyond imposing constraints, training
the models on a large amount of data is the ultimate cure, pointing to their
promise in intraday trading.
■Exercises
3.1. Show that ifY(t)in the AR(1) process in equation 3.1 is weakly sta-
tionary, then|φ|<1.Hint: Consider the variance ofY(t).
3.2. In the section on AR(p), we described a backtest on AUD.USD using
an AR(1) that achieved a CAGR of 158 percent using midprices. The
same .mat data set also contains bid and ask quotes separately. Backtest
the same strategy assuming we use market orders only. What is the
resulting CAGR?
3.3. Using MATLAB’sarimaandestimatefunctions, verify that using
ARIMA(p,0,q) to model log returns of AUD.USD gives the same
autoregressive coefficients as using ARIMA(p,1,q) to model log
prices. Show also that the best estimates forpandqare 1 and 9,
respectively.

3.4. Apply the VAR model to EWA and EWC, and generate daily buy/sell
trading signals when the predicted daily return is positive/negative.
Assuming we always trade $1 per ETF, what is the CAGR and Sharpe
ratio? Are there times when the trading signals for both ETFs have the
same sign?
3.5. Comparing themoving averagegenerated by equations (3.8)
and (3.9) with anN-day exponential moving average (e.g., see
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average), what is theNthat best fits
our estimated state variable? What constraint(s) would you need to
apply to theBorDmatrices in equations 3.8 and 3.9 in order to
enforce a largerN?
3.6. If you assume thatBis diagonal in equation 3.9, are you able to back-
test the Kalman filter trading strategy for EWC vs. EWA with a CAGR
of 26.2 percent and a Sharpe ratio of 2.4 using data from April 26,
2006, to April 9, 2012? (These are the results we obtained in Chan,
## 2013.)
3.7. Apply VAR and VEC on computer hardware stocks as shown in
thesectiononVAR(p)using log prices instead of prices. Do the
out-of-sample returns and Sharpe ratio improve?
3.8. Instead of using the Kalman filter to find themoving averageof prices,
use it to find the slope of the recent price trend. Assuming that this
slope persists into the future, backtest a trending strategy on, for
example, the computer hardware stocks.

- A time series is strictly stationary if all aspects of its behavior are
unchanged by shifts in time (Ruppert and Matteson, 2015). A weakly
stationary time series only requires that the mean and variance are
unchanged. If this is a multivariate time series, the covariance also
needs to be unchanged.

ost of the trading strategies in this book are developed based on
the process a theoretical physicist would use. Where a theoretical
physicist develops a hypothesis, designs an experiment to test that hypoth-
esis, and confirms the hypothesis based on the test results, we quantitative
traders develop a hunch about a possible inefficiency in the market (e.g.,
retail investors’ herd-like behavior leading to stock momentum), devise a
strategy to exploit that inefficiency, and use data to confirm whether that
strategy actually works. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) or machine
learning techniques is closer to the approach experimental physicists
might take in their work: we don’t have a preconceived theory of what
the most important factors affecting the market are, and therefore, we
need to explore as many factors and trading rules as possible with the
help of efficient algorithms. Finance practitioners often derisively refer
to this methodology asdata mining. There is some justification of their
derision: financial data are not only quite limited (unless we use tick
data), they are also not very stationary in the statistical sense. That is, the
probability distribution of returns does not stay constant forever. If we
just turn our machine learning algorithms loose on these data, it is very
easy to come up with trading rules that worked extremely well in certain

trading models built with human intelligence can do that, too. But we can
sometimes understand why it is that the model doesn’t work anymore and
take remedial actions. No such luck with machine-learned rules.
Despite our cautiousness toward AI techniques, keep in mind that this
is a rapidly advancing field, where practitioners are developing techniques
specifically designed to avoid the overfitting bias we alluded to. One may
remember that neural networks were dismissed as quite impractical just a
few years ago, but a breakthrough made in 2006 (Allen, 2015) revitalized
the field, and neural net experts are now much sought-after in organiza-
tions such as Google and Facebook. More pertinent to trading, I remember
a senior manager at the legendary quant fund Renaissance Technologies once
remarked to the press that one of their most profitable trading strategies was
also one that had no rational financial justification at all. That is also why
it endured without being arbitraged away by other traders. These are the
kind of trading rules that AI techniques can deliver to us. Another situation
where AI techniques will be useful is when someone gives you a set of indi-
cators, whether fundamental or technical, that you don’t have any idea how
to use and have no intuition about. Turning AI techniques loose on such
indicators would be the easiest way to proceed. The results may even aid
in gaining human understanding of the indicators. So let’s not presume that
our own minds and intuition have a monopoly on trading ideas and let AI
surprise us!
The machine learning techniques we describe in this chapter are fairly
basic and well-known. That’s why they have been encapsulated in commer-
cial software packages and are easily accessible to traders who do not wish
to reinvent the wheel or to become a full-time AI researcher. The software
packages that I use to demonstrate these techniques are MATLAB’s Statistics
and Machine Learning Toolbox and the Neural Network Toolbox, and in one
instance, the Bayes Net Toolbox written by Dr. Kevin Murphy at Google.
However, R programmers can easily find similar packages (Hothorn, 2014).
Though it may seem that we will be covering a hodgepodge of unrelated
models, they can be categorized in several ways. Stepwise regression,
regression tree, classification tree, support vector machine, and hidden
Markov models can be considered linear models, or at least piecewise
linear models, whereas a neural network is an explicitly nonlinear model.
Stepwise regression, regression tree, and neural network typically try to
predict response variables that are continuous, whereas classification tree

and support vector machine try to predict responses that are discrete.
(Hidden Markov models can work on either continuous or discrete data,
but our example in this chapter is discrete.) All but the hidden Markov
model use ‘‘supervised training’’ where we try to assign observable classes
to data, whereas the hidden Markov model uses ‘‘unsupervised training’’
where we try to assign unobserved classes to the data.
All of these models can be improved by a number of common techniques.
The first technique is called cross validation, where we train a lot of models
on subsets of one training data set, and pick only the one that performs best
out-of-sample. The second technique is calledbagging. Here, we artificially
create many training sets by resampling with replacement our original
training set, and we train a model on each of these replicated training
sets and average their predictions. The third technique is called random
subspace, where instead of randomly sampling the training data as in bag-
ging, we sample the predictors for each model that we create. The fourth
technique, called random forest, is a hybrid between bagging and random
subspace, and is especially designed for regression and classification trees.
All four techniques are designed with the aim of reducing overfitting on the
training set. There is a fifth technique that we will discuss, boosting, which
is designed to force the learning algorithm to focus on its past prediction
errors and improve on them.
To illustrate these models and techniques, we focus mostly on one sim-
ple example: the prediction of the ETF SPY’s next-day return based on its
past returns with various lookback. This allows us to compare the efficacy
and nuances of different models and techniques without the distraction of
understanding a new data set for each new technique. This doesn’t mean
that SPY is the most favorable instrument for AI methods, of course. You
are encouraged to try them out on your own favorite market. In fact, most
of these techniques work better if we have more predictors, and we can
readily find more fundamental variables than (uncorrelated) technical vari-
ables as predictors. Hence, we include one important example at the end to
illustrate the application of one of these techniques to identifying predictive
fundamental stock factors for returns prediction.
Since this is a book on practical trading, and not on the theoretical
foundation of finance, much less the theoretical foundation of machine
learning, we will not dwell on the intricate details of the algorithms
presented here. Trading strategies based on AI have earned a well-deserved
reputation of being ‘‘black-box.’’

closer to intuiting why the algorithm generates a certain trading signal at a
certain moment.
■Stepwise Regression
One key utility of AI is that an algorithm can automatically select the
most important independent variables (predictors) for the prediction of a
dependent (response) variable based on a model that specifies the functional
relationship between them. For example, if we want to predict the future
one-day return of SPY, one predictor might be the previous one-day return,
another might be its stochastic oscillator (for a technical analyst), the
third one might be its P/E ratio (for a fundamental analyst), and so on.
We don’t usually know which predictor is important, so we should just
throw everything but the kitchen sink at the AI algorithm, and hope for
the best. The AI algorithm will perform what is calledfeature selection.
The model that relates the predictor to the response variables need not be
complicated. In fact, we will begin with one of the simplest models—linear
regression—to illustrate the AI paradigm. The result of marrying feature
selection to linear regression is stepwise regression.
Let’s look at the example predicting SPY returns. Instead of using a mix-
ture of technical and fundamental predictors, let’s just use previous returns
with various lookbacks (1-day, 2-day, 5-day, and 20-day) as predictors.
In a usual multiple regression, we would fit the future one-day return to all
the predictors simultaneously and find the regression coefficients of all the
predictors (plus they-intercept.) This can be accomplished using thefitlm
function in MATLAB:
model_train=fitlm([ret1(trainset) ret2(trainset) ret5(trainset)
ret20(trainset)], retFut1(trainset), 'linear')
Theret1,ret2,...,ret20areT×1 arrays with previous returns of
various lookback, andretFut1is aT×1 array with the future one-day
return. By default,fitlmassumes there is a constant term, so we do not
need to include a column of 1s in the predictors. The parameter ‘‘linear’’
indicates we don’t want products of independent variables as predictors.
We should not use the entire data set for fitting this regression model—we
shall leave the second half of the data as the test set. Heretrainsetis an
index array denoting the indices of the first half of the data. This separation
between training and test sets is of course a procedure that we always
follow in building any trading model, but especially important in building

machine-learning models due to their propensity for overfitting. To see how
this model does on the training set as a sanity check, we apply thepredict
function tomodeland the training data:
retPred1=predict(model, [ret1(trainset) ret2(trainset)
ret5(trainset) ret20(trainset)]);
retPred1is similar toretFut1, but contains the predicted future one-day
returns instead of the actual future one-day returns contained inretFut1.
If we build a simple trading strategy by buying $1 of SPY whenretPred1is
positive, and shorting $1 when it is negative, holding just one day:
positions(retPred1 > 0)=1;
positions(retPred1 < 0)=-1;
we find that the CAGR is 34.3 percent, with a Sharpe ratio of 1.4. So this
model fits the training data from December 22, 2004, to September 15,
2009, quite well—so far, so good. We can repeat the same procedure on
the test data from September 16, 2009, to June 2, 2014. Running
retPred1=predict(model, [ret1(testset) ret2(testset) ret5(testset)
ret20(testset)]);
and applying the same simple trading strategy on the test set now yields
a CAGR of 0.4 percent, with a Sharpe ratio of 0.1. This model

does no
better than random on the test set. This establishes an easy benchmark for
stepwise regression to beat.
Stepwise regressiondiffers from multiple regression in that it starts with
just one ‘‘best’’ predictor based on some common goodness of fit criterion
such as the sum of squared error (the default for MATLAB’sstepwiselmfunc-
tion), Akaike information criterion (AIC), or Bayesian information criterion
(BIC). Then the algorithm will try to add other predictors one at a time
until the goodness of fit does not improve. Then it goes in reverse and tries
to remove predictors one at a time, again stopping when the goodness of fit
does not improve. In practice, to switch from using multiple regression to
stepwise regression in MATLAB is as simple as switching the name of the
function fromlmfittostepwiselm.
model=stepwiselm([ret1(trainset) ret2(trainset) ret5(trainset)
ret20(trainset)], retFut1(trainset), 'Upper', 'linear')
The input parameter name/value pair ‘‘Upper’’ with its value ‘‘linear’’ indi-
cates that we only want linear functions of the independent variables as
predictors, not products of them.

The algorithm picks just one predictor:ret2.
## 3
This one predictor causes
the in-sample CAGR to go from 34.3 percent to 43.5 percent, and the
Sharpe ratio from 1.4 to 1.6. This is unusually encouraging, because a
simpler model with fewer predictors usually produces worse results than a
complicated model in-sample. But more importantly, stepwise regression
causes the out-of-sample CAGR to go from 0.4 percent to 10.6 percent,
and the Sharpe ratio from 0.1 to 0.7, indicating the model is close to
achieving statistical significance (the threshold for that is a Sharpe ratio
of 1). The equity curve shown in Figure 4.1 suggests that most of the
performance comes during the earlier period from 2009 to 2011, but that
isn’t the fault of the algorithm. To improve on this, we can always retrain
the program at every step by adding the latest data point to the training set.
Also, the model makes a prediction of returns, but we have only used the
sign of the return as a trading signal. One way to use the magnitude of the
predicted return is to buy or sell only when the magnitude exceeds a certain
threshold. Another way is to buy or sell a dollar amount that is proportional
to the return magnitude. We will leave all these variations as exercises.
One last detail we should notice: the regression coefficient ofret2is
negative, meaning that this model predicts that future one-day return will

doesn’t mean that we should not use it to improve our own understanding
of the market!
■Regression Tree
Using a regression tree (and its sibling classification tree for discrete
dependent variables such as, ‘‘Will it be an up or down day tomorrow?’’) is
another way one can select important predictors. However, unlike stepwise
regression, where all the selected predictors are applied to all data jointly
just as in a multiple regression, regression trees take a hierarchical approach.
In fact, the regression tree algorithm has little to do with linear regression.
Once the algorithm picks the ‘‘best’’ predictor based on some criterion, it
will split the data into two subsets by applying an inequality condition on this
predictor (such as ‘‘previous two-day return<1.5%’’). The original data
form theparentnode, and each subset is achildnode. The algorithm will then
be iteratively applied to each child node, until a stopping condition is met.
The criterion that is used to pick the best predictor at each node is usually
based on minimizing the variance of the response variable in each child node
(Breiman et al., 1984). Minimizing the variance of the response variable
in a node is another way of saying we want to minimize the mean squared
error (MSE) of the predicted response compared to the true response,
because the predicted response for a node is none other than the average
of the response variables. The stopping condition is met when any of the
following occur:
- There is no reduction of variances compared to the variance of the par-
ent node; or
- There are too few observations in the parent node (MinParentSizeis an
input parameter); or
- Splitting the parent node using any predictor would have resulted in
a child node with too few observations (MinLeafSizeis another input
parameter); or
- The maximum number of nodes have been reached (MaxNumSplits,a
third input parameter, limits the total number of splits).
Note that due to the iterative nature of this algorithm, the same predictor
can be reused at each child node for an unlimited number of times. Each
‘‘leaf’’ of a tree (a child node without children itself) can be summarized
as a set of inequalities on the predictors (e.g., ‘‘previous two-day return
<1.5%’’and‘‘previous one-day return<−1.4%’’). We can therefore

## 
pick those leaves (equivalently, the set of inequalities) that have the average
response (e.g., high average future one-day return) we desire. When we
have a new data point from the test set that satisfies all the inequalities that
lead to a leaf with high average future return, we will predict that this data
point will generate a high future return, too.
We can try our hands at the regression tree algorithm on the same set of
data, predictors, and response variable (future one-day return of SPY) as we
used in the stepwise regression example. The program rTree.m is practically
the same as stepwiseLR.m: we just need to replace the functionstepwiselm
withfitrtree.
model=fitrtree([ret1(trainset) ret2(trainset) ret5(trainset)
ret20(trainset)], retFut1(trainset), 'MinLeafSize', 100);
We choose to setMinLeafSizeto 100, but you are free to experiment with
other values and see what is optimal on the trainset. Generally speaking
though, we don’t want to have a leaf size that is too small in order to avoid
overfitting. To see what the tree looks like, including the inequalities in each
child node, apply the functionviewto the model:
view(model, 'mode', 'graph'); % see the tree visually
which produces Figure 4.2.
We can examine the numbers below the leaf nodes: they indicate the
expected value of the response variable under the sequence of inequalities.

For example, if we want a leaf node with the highest expected value
(0.0047136 for the left-most node), we see that the sequence isx2<
0.015314,x1<−0.00244162,x1<−0.0139236, which we can paraphrase
as ret2<1.53% and ret1<−1.39%. This can be used as a ready-made trad-
ing rule for buying SPY. Similarly, we can look for a leaf node with the most
negative expected value (−0.004527 for the right-most node). The single
inequality that leads to that can be paraphrased as ret2>=1.53%. This
can be used as a trading rule for shorting SPY. Both trading rules are
mean-reverting, just as the trading model produced by stepwise regression.
If we buy SPY at the close and hold it one day according to the long rule,
and short SPY and hold it one day according to the short rule, we obtain a
CAGR of 28.8 percent with a Sharpe ratio of 1.5 on the training set, and
a CAGR of 3.9 percent with a Sharp ratio of 0.5 on the test set. This isn’t as
good as the stepwise regression result, and the equity curve in Figure 4.3
also shows that these mean reversion models worked only during the first
half of the test set.
One may wonder why we limit ourselves to the two extreme leaves
(extreme in terms of expected response), and do not generate a trading
rule based on the expected response of every single leaf? If we try that

(all we need to do is to use thepredictfunction we have used before in
stepwiseLR.m.), we will find that the in-sample CAGR will be boosted to
73 percent, but the out-of-sample CAGR will drop to−7.2 percent—a
clear symptom of overfitting. But there is a way to have your cake and eat
it, too. In the next three sections, we will explore some general techniques
for reducing overfitting so that we can in fact use all leaves for prediction.
■Cross Validation
Cross validation is a technique for reducing overfitting by testing for out-of-
sample performance as part of model building. To do this, we randomly
divide the training set intoKroughly equal subsets. Modeliwill be built
on the union of all subsets except thei
th
. We then test for the predictive
accuracy of modelion the out-of-samplei
th
part. (See Figure 4.4.) This is
called the cross-validation accuracy. Finally, we will pick the model that has
the highest cross-validation accuracy.
We can try this on the regression tree model we built in the previous
section that uses every leaf for generating trading signals. We simply need
to add the name/value pairs ‘‘CrossVal’’ and ‘‘On,’’ ‘‘KFold’’ and 5, when
usingfitrtreefor model building. This would generateK=5 trees stored in
model_cv below:
model_cv=fitrtree([ret1(trainset) ret2(trainset) ret5(trainset)
ret20(trainset)], retFut1(trainset),  'MinLeafSize', 100,
'CrossVal', 'On', 'KFold', 5);

## 
To find the cross-validation accuracy (or its inverse, the loss or mean
squared error of the predicted responses compared to the true responses)
of each tree, we apply thekfoldLossfunction to these trees and pick the tree
with the minimum loss:
L= kfoldLoss(model_cv,'mode','individual'); % Find the loss
(mean squared error) of the predicted responses in a fold
when compared against predictions made with a tree trained
on the out-of-fold data.
[∼, minLidx]=min(L); % pick the tree with the minimum loss,
i.e. with least overfitting error.
bestTree=model_cv.Trained{minLidx};
Running the predict function on the test set usingbestTreeas the model
generates a CAGR of 0.6 percent with a Sharpe ratio of 0.11, which is def-
initely better than the previous result without using cross validation, but
not as good as if we just pick the two extreme leaves. (If you run this pro-
gram with a different random seed, you will get a different tree and different
CAGR. This is because the cross-validation algorithm picks the subsets of
training data for each tree randomly.) The code for this is part of rTree.m.
Some readers may wonder why we pickK=5 instead of 10, which is the
MATLAB default for the number of subsets used for cross validation. The
reason is that while our training set from December 22, 2004, to September
15, 2009, may be a reasonable size for trading research, it is considered
quite small by machine learning standards. If we divide this training set into
10 subsets, the out-of-sample subset will be so small that the cross-validation
accuracy is subject to large statistical errors, and so the ‘‘best’’ tree produced
won’t necessarily be any good when applied to the test set. On the other
hand, if we setKto be too small, say 2, then we don’t have enough trained
models to choose the best one from.
■Bagging
In cross validation, we introduced the idea that it is often useful to present
somewhat different training data sets to the learning algorithm so that
it does not overfit to the statistical fluctuations in one single training set
that won’t be repeated in the test set. Bagging is another variation on this
theme. Instead of randomly dividing the original training set of sizeNinto
subsets as we did in cross validation, we randomly sampleNobservations
from the original training setwith replacementto form a replica (abag)of

Trim Size: 6in x 9inChan  c04.tex  V2 - 12/11/2016  12:44 A.M.  Page 94

## 
the original training set. Since we are sampling with replacement, some
observations from the original training set will be repeated multiple times
in the replica and other observations will be omitted (these will be called
out-of-bagobservations). We repeat this processKtimes, so that we form an
ensemble ofKsuch replicas, each with the original training set sizeN. Since
this process essentially increases the training sample size, it is also called
bootstrapping. Like cross validation, we will train a model (regression tree
in our example) on each replica, and test its predictive accuracy on the
corresponding out-of-bag (and, therefore, out-of-sample) observations.
(See Figure 4.5.) But unlike cross validation, we do not just pick the tree
with the most accurate out-of-bag prediction. We average the predicted
response fromallthe trees built from all the replicas.
To apply bagging to the regression tree learner, use theTreeBaggerinstead
of thefitrtreefunction in MATLAB:
model=TreeBagger(5, [ret1(trainset) ret2(trainset) ret5(trainset)
ret20(trainset)], retFut1(trainset), 'Method', 'regression',
'MinLeaf', 100);

) since this
was the number of trees we built with cross validation as well. This yielded
significantly better predictive performance than the cross validation model:
CAGR is 7.2 percent with a Sharpe ratio of 0.5. The equity curve is displayed
in Figure 4.6.
IncreasingKwill actually degrade out-of-sample performance, because
the average result of a large ensemble of replicas will be very similar to that
of using the original training set.
■Random Subspace and Random Forest
With bagging, we randomly sampledatawith replacement to train mul-
tiple models. With random subspace, we randomly samplepredictorswith
replacement (but with decreasing sampling probability for those that have
been chosen previously) to train multiple models. In both cases, we will
average the predictions of all these models (weak learners) so that the ensem-
ble prediction is stronger. Any method that trains many weak learners to
form a strong learner is called an ‘‘ensemble’’ method.

In MATLAB, the function that implements random subspace isfitensemble,
if we set the ‘‘Method’’ variable to ‘‘Subspace.’’ However, it only works on
classification problems (i.e., with discrete instead of continuous response
variables). We will discuss that in the section on ‘‘Classification Tree.’’ Also,
the random subspace method really shines only when we have a large number
of predictors, so we won’t be able to demonstrate it here using our SPY
example even if we were to discretize the response variable. Instead, we
invite you to try it as an exercise using the fundamental data set suggested in
the section ‘‘Application to Stocks Selection.’’
There is another ensemble method calledrandom forestthat is a hybrid
of bagging and random subspace. More specifically, a random forest is a
regression or classification tree where we start with a randomly selected
(with replacement) subset of training data, and at each split of the node,
choose the best predictor from a randomly selected (with replacement)
subset of all the available predictors. Again, we will average the prediction
of the weak learners. In MATLAB, random forest is implemented using the
TreeBaggerfunction, with the ‘‘NumPredictorsToSample’’ parameter set to any
number smaller than the total number of predictors. Actually, the MATLAB
default is to haveNumPredictorsToSampleset to one-third of the total number
of predictors, which is what we used in the bagging example in the previous
section and in rTreeBagger.m. If we actually want to use all the predictors
at every node for prediction, we can setNumPredictorsToSampleto ‘‘all.’’
This decreases the out-of-sample CAGR of the previous example from
7.2 percent to 1.5 percent, and the Sharpe ratio from 0.5 to 0.2.
■Boosting
As humans, we pride ourselves on our ability to learn from our past mistakes.
The best of us don’t waste our time reminiscing on past triumphs. It turns
out that we can teach our AI algorithms to do the same, and this method is
calledboosting.
Boosting involves applying a learning algorithm iteratively to the
prediction errors of the model constructed in the previous iteration. As a
first step in boosting, we apply a learning algorithm such as a regression
tree to the training data as before. The first step is complete once the tree is
constructed and predictions made for the training set. We begin the second
step by creating a new training set where the responses are the differences
between the actual responses and the predicted response from the first
model. The objective of this second tree is to minimize the square of these

differences. We will repeat this so as to create a total ofMtrees and take
the predictions of theM
th
tree as final. The hope is again to turn a weakly
predictive algorithm into a stronger one.
We will apply this procedure to the regression tree model that we created
before. We need to just replacefitrtreefunction with thefitensemblefunction
in our code (rTreeLSBoost.m), just as in the case with the random subspace
method. We need to specify ‘‘LSBoost’’ as the boosting algorithm, which is
the gradient descent method (Friedman, 1999) for boosting regression or
regression tree models. We also specifyMas the number of iterations for
boosting. Finally, we specify ‘‘Tree’’ as the learning algorithm.
model=fitensemble([ret1(trainset) ret2(trainset) ret5(trainset)
ret20(trainset)], retFut1(trainset), 'LSBoost', M, 'Tree');
As opposed to cross validation and bagging, boosting does not seem to
alleviate overfitting (although there are theoretical arguments on why it
won’t overfit). (See Kun, 2015.) We can see in Figure 4.7 the effect of
boosting the previously constructed regression tree on the train versus

test set. With increasing number of iterations, the Sharpe ratio on the
trainset increases rapidly, while the Sharpe ratio on the test set increases
much more slowly. In fact, the Sharpe ratio for the test set remains insignif-
icant at any reasonable number of iterations. Applying cross validation to
the best tree at each iteration actually worsens performance.
■Classification Tree
The core learning algorithms we have discussed so far assume that the
response variable is continuous. This is natural because we are mostly inter-
ested in expected returns in trading. But there are some learning algorithms
that are specifically designed for discrete (also called categorical) response
variables. There is no reason why we should deprive ourselves of them—
we just need to discretize our returns into, say, positive and negative
returns. In this section, we will apply the classification tree to the SPY
prediction task.
Classification tree is a close sibling of regression tree. With regression
tree, the best predictor to split a node is one that minimizes variance of
responses in the child nodes. With classification tree, the variance
of responses is replaced by the analogous Gini’s Diversity Index (GDI). For
a binary classification into positive (+) or negative (−) classes, GDI for a
node is
## 1−p
## 2
## +
## −p
## 2
## −
wherep
## +
is the fraction of observations with positive returns, andp
## −
is the
fraction of observations with negative returns. GDI has a minimum value of
zero, which is obtained when the node consists of observations of the same
class—that is, perfect classification. The best predictor to split a node is
one that minimizes the sum of the GDIs of both child nodes. Naturally, the
predicted response of a node is the observation that constitutes the highest
fraction.
To implement classification tree in MATLAB, simply replace the function
fitrtreein our program rTree.m withfitctree, taking care to discretize the
response variable.
## 5
Since we know that using the entire tree for prediction
suffers from severe data snooping bias, we will also impose fivefold cross
validation as we did with regression trees:
model=fitctree([ret1(trainset) ret2(trainset) ret5(trainset)
ret20(trainset)], retFut1(trainset) >= 0, 'MinLeafSize', 100,
'CrossVal', 'On', 'KFold', 5); % Response: True if >=0,
False if < 0.

We can use this model in an obvious way to generate trading signal: just
buy when the predicted response is positive, and short when it is nega-
tive. The complete program is in cTree.m. The resulting CAGR on the
test set is 4.8 percent, with a Sharpe ratio of 0.4, which is better than the
cross-validated regression tree results, but not as good as the regression tree
with random forest. (Of course, you can apply the random forest algorithm
to the classification tree as well. This is left as an exercise.)
One doesn’t have to categorize the response as positive or negative
returns. We can create a class for high positive returns (i.e., returns
higher than some threshold) and another one for the complement, and
generate buy signals only when we predict this high-return class. Similarly,
we can create a class for low negative returns and generate short signals
for predictions in this class. However, this doesn’t seem to improve the
performance of the trading strategy.
■Support Vector Machine
The support vector machine (SVM) is another popular classification tech-
nique that works on discrete responses. The intuitive idea behind it is quite
visually appealing: let’s imagine each sample data point resides in an
m-dimensional space, wheremis the number of predictors (which are still
continuous variables). Let’s say some of these data points are labeled ‘‘plus’’
theremainingonesarelabeled‘‘minuses.’’(SeeFigure4.8).Theseplusesand

thism-dimensional space that can separate the pluses from the minuses. Fur-
thermore, it wants to separate them with the largest possible margin. If that
can be done, we have achieved our classification task: whenever a data point
has coordinates on one side of this hyperplane, we will know exactly which
response category it will have. In our 2-D illustration in Figure 4.8, the black
line in the middle achieves such a clean separation: all the minuses are on the
right side of the line, and all the pluses are on the left. The pluses that come
closest to the separating hyperplane (line) form a set of ‘‘support vectors,’’
and so do the minuses that come closest. The separation between the two
sets of support vectors is the margin which we maximized with our SVM.
Of course, real data are rarely as obliging as our fantasy data set. Even
with the ‘‘best’’ hyperplane, we will find pluses on the right side and minuses
on the left. We can attempt to find the best hyperplane by maximizing the
margin of separation while simultaneously minimizing a penalty term that
penalizes misclassified data points. (The mathematical details can be found
in Anonymous, 2015.) To use the SVM in MATLAB, simply substitute the
functionfitcsvmforfitctreeand again apply fivefold cross validation.

model=fitcsvm([ret1(trainset) ret2(trainset) ret5(trainset)
ret20(trainset)], retFut1(trainset) >= 0, 'CrossVal', 'On',
'KFold', 5); % Response: True if >=0, False if < 0.
The resulting CAGR of 13.3 percent with a Sharpe ratio of 0.8 on the
test set is much superior to that of the classification tree. The equity curve
in Figure 4.9 also shows no deterioration in the more recent period. This
outperformance is perhaps because the model resulting from this basic
version of the SVM is genuinely linear: after all, it is just a hyperplane.
(The classification tree can be thought of as piece-wise linear only.) Linear
models avoid overfitting and generate better results on out-of-sample data.
Interestingly, this same linear model performs worse on the training set,
perhaps for the same reason.
Sometimes, however, we do need to transform predictors nonlinearly
before the SVM is able to classify the data. These transformations are
carried out by the Kernel function. Instead of a linear Kernel function,
we can specify a polynomial function. Instead of setting the Kernel scale
to 1, we can specify ‘‘auto’’ such that the algorithm will select an optimal
Kernel scale. We have tried this new configuration, and the results weren’t
improved. If we try the radial basis (Gaussian) function, the results are
slightly improved. There is also a multilayer perceptron (sigmoidal) function

that we can apply, but it isn’t part of the Statistics and Machine Learning
Toolbox, so you would have to construct it yourself. (Interested readers can
explore whether they can extract this function from the Neural Network
Toolbox and apply that to the SVM.) Applying a nonlinear Kernel function
to the predictors is effectively using a curved membrane instead of a plane to
cut through the data. Another way of thinking about the Kernel transforma-
tion is that we are transforming the data into a higher dimensional space such
that a hyperplane there can cleanly separate them. A reverse transformation
of this hyperplane appears as a curve, not a line, in the original space. This
allows for much more flexibility (and more room for overfitting).
■Hidden Markov Model
It is common for traders to label a certain market moment ‘‘bull’’ or
‘‘bear.’’ It isn’t clear, though, what constitutes a bull or bear market, since
we can certainly experience down days in a bull market and up days in a bear
market. No two cable TV commentators are able to agree on the exact defi-
nition of a bull or bear market. The same goes for ‘‘mean-reverting’’ versus

‘‘trending’’ markets, or ‘‘risk-on’’ versus ‘‘risk-off’’ regimes. Machine
learners, however, are quite accustomed to such ambiguity. More precisely,
they are accustomed to classification problems where the classes are not
actually observable, unlike the ‘‘up’’ or ‘‘down’’ days that we asked the
SVM to classify in the previous section. Such classification of unobservable
(hidden) states are the domain of ‘‘unsupervised learning’’ methods.
One of the most well-known models with hidden states is the Hidden
Markov Model (HMM). The easiest way to understand an HMM is to imag-
ine that bull versus bear markets are two hidden states, and a transition
probability matrix describes the probabilities that the market would jump
from one state to another from one day to the next. For example, if we label
the bull market as the first state, and bear market as the second, a transition
matrixTsuch as
## T=
## [
## 0.60  0.40
## 0.75  0.25
## ]
indicates that there is a probability of 0.6 that a bull market will remain so the
next day. Of course, that also implies it has a probability of 0.4 to transition
to a bear market. This matrix also indicates there is a probability of 0.25
that a bear market will remain so the next day, and a probability of 0.75 that
it will transition to a bull market. Naturally, the probabilities on each row
mustaddupto1.
Besides the transition probabilities as tabulated in the transition matrix,
we also need to know the probabilities that a bear state will ‘‘emit’’ a down
day and an up day, respectively. The down and up days are calledemissions,
or observables. Similarly, we need to know the same for a bull state. These
‘‘emission’’ probabilities are tabulated in an emission probability matrixE
such as
## E=
## [
## 0.19  0.81
## 0.97  0.03
## ]
where we label the down days as the first emission symbol and the up days
as the second. So this emission matrix is telling us that there is a 19 percent
chance that a bull state will emit a down day, and an 81 percent chance that
it will emit an up day. There is a 97 percent chance that a bear state will
emit a down day and a 3 percent chance that it will emit an up day. Again,
the probabilities of each row must sum to one. Figure 4.10 illustrates the
transition matrix.
Since bull and bear are unobservable, they are just names we give to the
states. They can just as well be called ‘‘mean-reverting’’ and ‘‘trending,’’

or ‘‘risk-on’’ and ‘‘risk-off,’’ or even ‘‘greed’’ and ‘‘fear,’’ and the learn-
ing algorithm will be none the wiser. The only assumption we have made
is that the down and up days are generated by two unobservable states,
in order to account for the fact that the probabilities of observing the up
and down days seem not to be described satisfactorily by a stationary prob-
ability distribution. In other words, we can regard HMM as just a more
complicated time-series model than the ones we described in Chapter 3,
with more parameters to estimate, and needless to say, more scope for data-
snooping bias.
Just like other learning algorithms, the parameters (namely, the
transmission matrixTand the emission matrixE, and possibly the prior
probability distribution on the emissions) need to be estimated using the
training set. One of the most famous unsupervised learning algorithms
for an HMM, and indeed for any models with hidden states, is the EM
algorithm (Murphy, 2012). Mathworks’ Statistics and Machine Learning
Toolbox does have the functionhmmtrainthat implements a version of the
EM algorithm, but unfortunately, it often returns singular solutions for
unbeknownst reasons. Instead, we used an open-source software called
Bayes Net Toolbox for MATLAB (https://code.google.com/p/bnt/) for
training. This is a complex piece of software, and quite difficult to use. We
used their function calledlearn_params_dbn_emfor training, as shown in
our program hmm_train.m. The goal of training is, as usual, to find the
parameters that generate the maximum log likelihood of the emissions.
Since I expect there will be multiple local maxima, I run this training
process 10 times, record the likelihood achieved for each maximum,
and pick the model that has the highest likelihood among them. (Of
course, if your computer is much faster than mine, or if you have much
more patience than I did, you can run this many more times than 10.)
Running this on SPY daily returns gives theTandEmatrices that I used
previously.

For prediction, we return to Mathworks’ Statistics Toolbox. We need the
functionhmmdecode, which computes the probabilities of the hidden states
from the initial time up to timetand stores them aspstates(1∶t). These
probabilities are computed given known transmission and emission matrices
and conditioned on our knowledge of the observed emissionsdatastored
in at×1 vector. To predict the emission at timet+1, we need to know
pstates(t+1),whichisgivenbyT
## ′
×pstates(t),whereT
## ′
is the transpose
ofT. Then the probabilities of emissions arepemis(t+1)=E
## ′
## ×pstates
(t+1)=E
## ′
## ×T
## ′
×pstates(t). The MATLAB code fragment for this is
pemis=NaN(2, size(data, 1));
for t=1:size(data, 1)-1
## [pstates]=hmmdecode(data(1:t)', T, E);
pemis(:, t+1)=E'*T'*pstates(:, end);
end
Note that this algorithm requires us to runhmmdecodewithallpreviously
observed data as input. It is not an ‘‘online’’ algorithm where we can just
add the latest data point at timetand it would updatepstates(t). In contrast,
the continuous sibling of HMM is the Kalman filter, where we have indeed
used an online algorithm to update our estimates of the hidden state variable
and other parameters in our discussion in Chan (2013) and again mentioned
in Chapter 3 of this book. We will leave the task of finding (or implementing
one from scratch) an online decoding function for HMM as an exercise.
Given the emission probabilities for the next day, we can construct a
simple trading strategy that buys SPY if the probability of ‘‘up’’ is higher
than ‘‘down,’’ and vice versa. We have created the program hmm_test.m to
do just that. For the training set, it performed decently, giving a CAGR of
8.7 percent, but it gives a CAGR of 1 percent for the test set.
There are many variations to the way we builds an HMM to predict the
next day return. Instead of estimating parameters using the first half of the
data as training set, we can perform estimation with every new observed
emission. Instead of discrete emissions (up or down days), we can model
them as continuous variables with some parametric distributions such as
Gaussian or Student-t(Dueker, 2006). Instead of the emissions depending
only on the hidden state variables, they can depend on some observed input
variables too (such as the predictors used in all the supervised models in
this chapter so far).
There is a side benefit of using HMM, aside from using it to predict the
next emission. Given the observed emissions, HMM can tell us what the

algorithm and the cofounder of Qualcomm, Inc., which likely made the chip

states=hmmviterbi(data, T, E);
What is the benefit of knowing the most probable state sequence? Next
time, if someone asks you whether you think this is a bull or bear market,
you can consult your HMM and give them a well-defined answer.

■Neural Network
Neural network may be the most well-known of the machine learning
algorithms. Because of its long history, it has also evolved into many
subspecies, architectures, and training algorithms. It is in fact so evolved
that Mathworks decided to gather all neural network algorithms into
a separate Neural Network Toolbox. We certainly won’t be able to
do justice to all its flavors in a few short paragraphs. Instead, we will
highlight the most basic architecture that is suitable for our SPY returns
prediction task.
We can understand neural network as simply a way to approximate any
function of an arbitrary number of predictor variables by a linear function
of sigmoid functionsS(x)=1∕(1+e
## −x
), or linear function of sigmoid
functions of linear functions of sigmoid functions, and so on. How many
iterations of these sigmoid functions to use, how much weight to put on
each, how to connect the output of one such function to the input of
another, can only be decided by experimentation and optimization on the
training set. Determining the weight of each function based on the training
data set is the job of the training algorithm, which is also an optimization
problem on the training set.
The most basic architecture we can use is the feed forward network.
A feed forward network consists of a number of hidden layers, each with
a number of ‘‘neurons’’ that represent the sigmoid functions (with different
weights), and a final output layer that represents a linear function. In the
Neural Network Toolbox, the number of neurons in each layer can be spec-
ified as an input parameterhiddenSizes(a row vector) to thefeedforwardnet
function. For example, we can specify
hiddenSizes=[2 4 3];

which indicates the first layer has 2 neurons, the second 4 neurons, and the
third 3. This means that our input vectorx
i
, which in the SPY example has
a dimension of 4, plus the constant 1 just like the constant offset of a linear
regression, is first summed into a scalar with different weights:
## I
j
## =

j,i
is the weight (to be determined
during the training phase of the network) for thei
th
component of the input
vector for thej
th
neuron, andw
j,0
is its constant offset. The output of each
of these two linear functions of the input is then fed into its corresponding
sigmoid function.
If the sigmoid functionwerejust the identity functionS(I
j
## )=I
j
, this
neuron would be just our usual multiple linear regression fit discussed
in the beginning of the section on stepwise regression. But instead, we
believe a nonlinear function will fit better, and thus neural networks use the
sigmoidal form shown before. The output of the two first layer neurons is
avectorS(I
j
)with a dimension of 2, which is then fed as input into each of
four neurons in the second layer, and so on. Finally, the output of the final
three neurons in the third layer is then fed as a three-vector into the output
layer with just one node, this time just a linear function. This assumes, as in
our example, that the output is a scalary. If the output is a vector, then there
will be several nodes in the output layer corresponding to the dimension of
the output vector. This sequence of iterated operations on an input vector:
multiplication by weights (w), summation of different components (Σ), and
transformation by the sigmoid function (S), is represented by the network
diagram in Figure 4.11.

Instead of starting with all these hidden layers and multiple neurons for
our SPY return prediction problem, let’s just start with one hidden layer
with one neuron (hiddenSizes=1). Overfitting is a paramount concern, as
always, and more hidden layers with more neurons make things worse. We
will not discuss the training algorithm for the weights (w), except to note
that there is randomness involving the initial guesses of the weights, and
these different guesses will cause the final network to settle onto different
local minima in network prediction error on the trainset. To minimize over-
fitting, the training algorithm utilizes a cross validation data set, whose size
is specified by the user:
net.divideParam.trainRatio=0.6; % 0.6 (default is 0.7) Pick 4/5
of trainset randomly to serve as train data
net.divideParam.valRatio=0.4; % 0.4 (default is 0.15) Pick 1/5
of remaining trainset to serve as validation data for early
stopping
net.divideParam.testRatio=0;
where trainRatio indicates the percentage of the training data set we will
randomly pick for prediction error minimization, valRatio indicates the
percentage of the validation set, and testRatio is the percentage of the test
set. If during network training, the error on the validation set starts to
increase, training will stop immediately. We set the test set to zero, because
it actually isn’t used during the training, and we have our own test set
(which is half our data) for backtesting the trading strategy. You can verify
that (using the same random number generator seed) the in-sample CAGR
is 19 percent, but the out-of-sample CAGR is−4 percent.
## 8
We haven’t
solved the overfitting problem yet.
We can try more hidden layers withhiddenSizes=[1, 1]. This neither
improves the in-sample nor the out-of-sample result. On the other hand, if
we increase the number of nodes in each layer by settinghiddenSizes=[2, 2],
we obtain an in-sample CAGR of 20 percent and an out-of-sample CAGR
of 5 percent. This might look like a major improvement, but the result is
very sensitive to what random seed we use. We need a way to reduce this
sensitive dependence and increase the robustness of the resulting network.
There are two ways to reduce dependence on the initial guesses. One is
called retraining, which is a lot like cross-validation. We will train, say, 100
different networks with different initial guesses for the weights and different
selection of the data as trainset (60 percent of original trainset as before)
and validation set (remaining 40 percent). We record the prediction error

hidden layers with various number of neurons per layer and recorded the
results in Table 4.1.
## 9
We can see that increasing the number of hidden layers or the number
of neurons per layer often increases the in-sample performance, but to the
detriment of the out-of-sample performance. The conclusion from this
experiment is that, to avoid overfitting, we can only use one single neuron
in one single layer for this problem.
The other way to reduce dependence on initial guesses is to again train 100
networks, but instead of picking the best, we average the predicted returns
of all 100. This is a lot like bagging. The result of this experiment
## 10
is shown
in Table 4.2.
The conclusion from surveying the two methods of training ensemble of
neural networks is that only the simplest network with just one single node
produces the best, consistent, result. But even that is a fairly weak result
compared to that of the previously discussed methods.
This conclusion may create cognitive dissonance, as latelydeep learning
has been touted as a technique that can accomplish fantastic pattern

recognition tasks. These are neural networks with many layers and few
nodes per layer. Researchers in deep learning assert that such configurations
enable easier learning, and result in better predictive powers, than networks
with fewer layers but more nodes per layer. However, such observations
probably hold true only for problems with a higher dimensional input vector
(i.e., more predictors) as well as more data samples. Such feature-rich data
sets are not common in finance, unless we have access to order book or
unstructured (e.g., news) data.
■Data Aggregation and Normalization
Machine learning algorithms benefit from lots of training data. If we are just
trying to predict one instrument’s returns (as we have been doing so far in
this chapter), the model built tends to be overfitted. So instead of predicting
SPY returns, can we try to predict the returns of every stock component of
the SPX index? Surely, we will have 500 times more data in this case? In a
sense, yes, but not if we just naively train a separate model on each stock,
ending up with 500 models. We will only benefit from the increased data
if we aggregate all these data into one vector and use that to train just one
model. To do that, we will need tonormalizethe data first.
Data normalization is necessary when aggregating data from different
stocks because their returns will have quite different volatility. For example,
it won’t be sensible to have a rule that says ‘‘Short the stock when the
previous return is greater than 100 percent’’ because while WTW have
gone up more than 100 percent on the day when Oprah decided to take a
stake in it, WMT with its more than $188 billion market cap may never see
such a day till the end of time. Clearly, we need to normalize the stocks’
predictors by their volatilities before aggregating them and feeding them
into any machine learning algorithm. (Of course, this applies only to those
predictors that are not already normalized. A technical indicator such as
the Relative Strength Index is already normalized and does not require
further treatment.) Just as predictors need to be normalized, the response
variable also needs to be normalized in a similar way. It won’t be sensible
to predict that a stock, any stock, is expected to have a next-day return
of 10 percent, a return that would be much more onerous to achieve for
WMT than for WTW.
In the example depicted in rTree_SPX.m, we use the same predictors
featured in previous sections to predict the future one-day return of a stock

in the SPX index, except that these predictors are all normalized by their
past daily return volatilities:
ret1N=ret1./vol1;
ret2N=ret2./vol1;
ret5N=ret5./vol1;
ret20N=ret20./vol1;
We will do the same to the response variable
retFut1N=retFut1./vol1;
We could just as well have divided the returns by two-day return
volatility, or three-day return volatility, and so on. The exact normalization
factor is not important: what is important is to make sure all these
normalized return variables have similar magnitude. These data, which
range from January 3, 2007, to December 31, 2013, are obtained from
CRSP and are survivorship-bias-free.
## 11
Furthermore, to avoid issues related
to the consolidated closing prices (see discussion in Chapter 6), we use the
midprice at the market close as our prices.
Unlike the variables in the previous sections, however, these variables are
T×Smatrices, whereTis the number of historical days in the data, andS
is the number of stocks (actually greater than 500, since we need to include
stocks that were historically in the SPX index but are no longer there).
To combine all the columns of data belonging to different stocks into one
single(T×S)×1 vector, we use thereshapefunction (see Example 2.2 for
a similar procedure):
X=NaN(length(trainset)*length(syms), 4);
X(:, 1)=reshape(ret1N(trainset, :), [length(trainset)*length
## (syms) 1]);
X(:, 2)=reshape(ret2N(trainset, :), [length(trainset)*length
## (syms) 1]);
X(:, 3)=reshape(ret5N(trainset, :), [length(trainset)*length
## (syms) 1]);
X(:, 4)=reshape(ret20N(trainset, :), [length(trainset)*length
## (syms) 1]);
Y=reshape(retFut1N(trainset, :), [length(trainset)*length(syms) 1]);
% dependent variable
Once the data are thus aggregated, the training and prediction can go on as
before. We use the cross-validated regression tree as our learning algorithm.
But once the best tree is selected, we need to unpack the vector containing

The out-of-sample CAGR of this strategy is 2.3 percent, with a Sharpe
ratio of 0.9. As can be seen from the cumulative return curve in Figure 4.12,
the strategy performed best during the financial turmoil in the aftermath of
the US Treasury debt downgrade in August 2011.
In case you wonder what the performance is like if we did not normalize
the variables, we would get a CAGR of−0.7 percent with a Sharpe ratio
of−0.4.
■Application to Stocks Selection
Throughout this chapter, we have stuck to using a few simple returns vari-
ables as predictors. But actually, one of the more interesting applications of
machine learning to finance may be the discovery of predictive fundamental
factors. Recall that when we discussed factor models in Chapter 2, all factors

are presumed useful and entered as input to a multiple regression. Here, we
can try stepwise regression to find out which factors really matter.
As in the case with technical variables discussed in the previous section,
there are some fundamental variables such as earnings per share that clearly
need to be normalized. But the normalization this time is by total revenue
or market capitalization, not by volatility, so that data from different stocks
can be aggregated. To avoid this complication, we have chosen only those
variables that are company-size-independent as input, which are listed in
Table 4.3. (These fundamental data were obtained from Sharadar’s Core US
Fundamentals database delivered through Quandl.com.)

After aggregating these input variables in the same manner described in
the previous section, and using the same function as we did in the ‘‘Stepwise
Regression’’ section, we found that the algorithm
## 12
selected the variables
displayed in Table 4.4 as significant predictors for the return in the next
quarter (or more precisely, 63 trading days). These selections are based on
data from January, 3, 2007, to December, 31, 2013. Note that most rows
of X, theT×Spredictors matrix, have NaN as values. This is because most
stocks on most days have no quarterly earnings announcements that will
determine these fundamental factors. But the delightful feature of thestep-
wiselmfunction, just as thefitlmor other functions in the Statistics Toolbox,
is that it will automatically ignore rows in the predictors matrix with NaNs.
To turn this prediction into a trading strategy, we simply buy and hold for
63 days, whenever the predicted return is positive, and vice versa when it is
negative. The code fragment for doing that is listed below:
longs=backshift(1, retPred1>0); %1 day later
shorts=backshift(1, retPred1<0);
longs(1, :)=false;
shorts(1, :)=false;
positions=zeros(size(retPred1));
for h=0:holdingDays-1
long_lag=backshift(h, longs);
long_lag(isnan(long_lag))=false;
long_lag=logical(long_lag);

short_lag(isnan(short_lag))=false;
short_lag=logical(short_lag);
positions(long_lag)=positions(long_lag)+1;
positions(short_lag)=positions(short_lag)-1;
end
Of course, this implies that we may end up buying one unit of capital
every day for 63 days straight. Hence we need to divide the total P&L due
to all these units of capital by 63 in order to compute a daily return that is
not levered 63 times:
dailyRet=smartsum(backshift(1, positions).*ret1(testset, :), 2)./
smartsum(abs(backshift(1, positions)), 2);
The out-of-sample CAGR is 4 percent with a Sharpe ratio of 1.1. The
cumulative return curve is shown in Figure 4.13.

■Summary
One lesson that stands out from this plethora of AI techniques is that meth-
ods to improve on the weak learners and reduce overfitting are as important
as which weak learner to start with. These methods include cross valida-
tion, bagging, random subspaces, random forests, and retraining and aver-
aging. All these methods try to introduce artificial randomness in either
the data or the predictor choices, and seek to train as many learners as
possible based on this randomness. The hope is that the average over all
these weak learners, or picking the best of these weak learners, will yield a
model that generalizes better out-of-sample data, and we often succeed in
doing that.
More training data (the number of rows in an input array) and more
predictors (the number of columns) are always better for machine learning
algorithms. It is therefore no surprise that many of these techniques
have mediocre performance on our SPY training data set with just about
1,000 rows, and a paltry 4 columns. Even our SPX component stocks
training data isn’t much better: it has only about 10,000 rows,
## 13
and
27 columns. Typical machine learning problems often have millions of rows
and hundreds of predictors. At the very least, for the SPY problem, we
should try all the technical indicators that have ever been invented, and
for the SPX component stocks problem, we should include factors that
require normalization by market capitalization. Where else can we find
data sets with orders of magnitude more data in the financial markets?
One promising direction is to study high-frequency data (Rechenthin,
2014); in particular, level 2 quotes sampled at 1 millisecond frequency
or higher. Another promising direction is to study unstructured data
(Kazemian, 2014) such as news releases and social media and see if
they portend financial market movements. Domingos (2012) wrote:
‘‘...efficacy of a machine learning algorithm relies heavily on the input
features.’’
When faced with a new prediction problem, what techniques should you
try? The answer is easy: Start with the simplest technique (such as stepwise
regression) and proceed to the most complicated (such as neural network)
if the simpler techniques do not yield good performance. In trading, com-
plexity doesn’t pay.

■Exercises
4.1. When using stepwise regression to predict SPY’s next-day return,
retrain the model every day by adding the latest data to the training
set. Does this increase the CAGR to above 10.6 percent and Sharpe
ratio to above 0.7 over the period September 16, 2009, to June 2,
2014, for the trading model suggested in the section on Stepwise
## Regression?
4.2. Similar to Exercise 4.1, modify the trading strategy to generate
buy or sell signals only if the return magnitude exceeds a certain
threshold. What threshold works best in-sample? Does it also
generate out-of-sample CAGR and Sharpe ratio that are higher than
the original strategy?
4.3. Similar to Exercise 4.2, modify the trading strategy so that the
dollar amount it buys or shorts is proportional to the magnitude
of the predicted return. Adjust the proportionality constant so that
the average absolute market value over the training set is $1. Then
calculate the CAGR based on the levered return. Is the out-of-sample
CAGR higher than the original strategy?
4.4. Use the fundamental data set presented in the section on ‘‘Application
to Stocks Selection’’ and discretize the response variable to predict
an up or down quarter. Apply the random subspace method and see
if it improves out-of-sample predictive accuracy. Also, try the ran-
dom forest method with classification trees to compare. What does
‘‘averaging the predicted response’’ mean when the response is a dis-
crete (categorical) variable?
4.5. Improve on the performance of our basic SVM by trying out different
Kernel functions and Kernel scale. What settings are best?
4.6. Look for software that implements online decoding of an HMM and
use this to decode our SPY model’s hidden states without using the
for-loop.
4.7. Re-estimate the HMM model for SPY at every time step prior to pre-
diction. Does this improve the out-of-sample CAGR of the trading
strategy?
4.8. Use the HMM model for SPY and determine if today is a bull or bear
market.

## CHAPTER 5
## Options Strategies
## I
t is hard to trade options algorithmically. This is not because the theories
are mathematically advanced (although they are). We don’t need to
completely understand the derivation of the Black-Scholes equation or
use stochastic calculus in order to backtest and execute options strategies
profitably. You may be surprised to find that there are very few equations
in this chapter, as there are many good books out there for those who want
to learn about the theoretical derivations (Hull, 2014; Oksendal, 2013).
There are also many well-known options trading strategies that have been
explained in careful detail previously (McMillan, 2002; Augen, 2008;
Augen, 2009; Sinclair, 2010; Sinclair 2013; James, 2015). But not many of
these books actually describe backtests of intraday strategies or strategies
that are applied to a large number of options on a portfolio of stocks, which
is our main focus in this chapter. Since each stock (or any other type of
underlying, such as stock index, future, bond, or currency) can have many
options with different tenors (time-to-expiration) and different strikes, it
can be quite a complicated task to backtest the selection of some of these
options to form a portfolio.
The options strategies described here are mostly delta-neutral strategies.
Delta is the rate of change of the option value with respect to the change
in the underlying stock price. Delta-neutral means that the delta of our
portfolio is zero, or nearly so. The reason we focus on such strategies is
that, if you are interested in being exposed to delta, you might as well just
buy (or short) stocks instead. You would incur far lower transaction costs
trading stocks due to their much higher liquidity. Trading delta-neutral
strategies means you are trading the other determinants of option prices:
notably volatility and time-to-maturity. Many people think of trading
options as trading volatilities. If we think volatility will be lower, we may
collect the options premium by shorting them (covered in the section

‘‘Trading Volatility without Options’’). If we think volatility may spike
up due to some events or because it is otherwise underpriced currently,
we may buy them (see the section ‘‘Event-Driven Strategies’’). But it is
important to note that we seldom can make a pure bet on volatility: if you
are net short options because you want to short volatility, you will be long
theta (the change of option value due to the passage of time, other factors
being unchanged), and vice versa.
Sometimes when we think that volatility is high, but instead of shorting
options, we trade the underlying using a mean reversion strategy, which is
effectively shorting volatility (Ang, 2014). At the same time, we want to pro-
tect against tail events. For this, the section on ‘‘Gamma Scalping’’ fits our
needs. Sometimes we are not even betting on the direction of the volatil-
ity, but on the mean reversion of the implied volatilities between differ-
ent instruments (discussed in ‘‘Cross-sectional Mean Reversion of Implied
Volatility’’). Other times, we may not even bet on volatilities at all, but on
correlations (see the section on ‘‘Dispersion Trading’’). In all these cases, we
will not be buying a single option, since that won’t have zero delta, but two or
more of them, often in packages with names like straddles or strangles. We
will give examples of the concrete implementation for each of the strategies
in this chapter. Finally, we will explain why these backtest results are quite
tenuous guides to whether the strategies will be profitable in live trading.
While no mathematical sophistication is required to understand these
strategies, we assume the reader has some basic familiarity with options, so
that concepts such as moneyness (e.g., OTM, ATM, ITM), tenor, implied
volatility, and the Greeks (e.g., delta, gamma, theta, vega) won’t be foreign
concepts.
■Trading Volatility without Options
A large and profitable industry has existed for centuries shorting volatility—
the insurance industry. Similarly, hedge funds in aggregate make their money
from shorting options (Ang, 2014, p. 219). The reason selling insurance (or
equivalently,sellingoptions)isprofitableisthatinsurancehasadecayingtime
value: as time goes on, if nothing bad happens, the value of the insurance
contract continues to drop. Of course, the key condition is that ‘‘nothing bad
happens.’’ But that’s the same risk we are taking by being long in equities.
Assuming that we are comfortable with taking this risk, we only need to
figure out how to extract the most return from it as consistently and effi-
cientlyaspossible,andwithoutbankruptingourselvesduringfinancialcrises.
The simplest strategy for an equity investor to profit from the equity risk
premium is to buy-and-hold a stock index. This beats many sophisticated

strategies in unlevered returns, though perhaps not in Sharpe ratio, over the
long term. Similarly, the simplest strategy for an option investor is to short
the futures or ETNs that track stock index volatility. For example, we can
compare buy-and-hold SPY versus short-and-hold the front contract of the
VX future. Of course, options and futures do expire, so it is not possible to
really ‘‘hold’’ a constant short position in them. We need to continuously roll
them to the next nearby contract. (We can short-and-hold the ETN VXX,
but it has a relatively short history, which inconveniently misses the 2008
financial crisis for our comparison. In any case, holding VXX just means
someone else is doing the rolling forward of the underlying VX futures on
your behalf.) Also, the volatility of SPY is much smaller than the volatility of
VX, so just comparing their returns is not very fair. One can manufacture a
high positive return from practically any instrument or strategy as long as it
has a positive return and we crank up the leverage. One fair way of compar-
ison is to leverage each instrument by their Kelly-optimal leverage (see the
section ‘‘Portfolio Optimization’’ in Chapter 1), and compare their com-
pounded returns. This of course differs slightly from buying-and-holding,
since maintaining a constant leverage requires daily rebalancing of our lev-
ered position in SPY or VX. Figure 5.1 shows a comparison of the optimally

Both ‘‘strategies’’ have dizzying drawdowns, but shorting volatility has
much higher returns and Calmar ratio than buying the equity index. See
Example 5.1 for the implementation details of this comparison.
Example 5.1: Comparing the levered, compounded
returns of SPY and VX
Before we compute the levered, compounded returns of anything, we
should first compute its unlevered, simple daily returns. This is quite
trivial forSPY, but not sofortheVXfuture. SincetheVXfutureexpires
monthly,computingthedailyreturnsofVXreallymeanscomputingthe
daily returns of the front contract. We roll to the next nearby contract
seven trading days before expiration. Since we are going to be short
VX, we actually want the negative daily return of VX. Assuming that
the daily returns of all the contracts are contained in a T×Marray
ret, where T is the number of trading days and M is the number of
contracts, the code fragment to piece together the daily returns of the
front contract into a T×1arrayret_VXisshownbelow:

To find the optimal Kelly leverage for SPY and VX, respectively,
these codes will do:
kelly_vx=mean(ret_VX)/var(ret_VX)
kelly_spy=mean(ret_SPY)/var(ret_SPY)
Then finally, the levered, compounded cumulative returns are:

spy_kelly_cumret=cumprod(1+kelly_spy*ret_SPY)-1;
## %  2.152202064271893
Can we modify the VX strategy to reduce drawdown and improve the
pitiable Calmar ratio? Since the ES future’s returns anticorrelate very
well with that of the VX future (Chan, 2013): We can buy VXandES
(with number of contracts in the ratio 0.3906:1) whenever VX is in
backwardation with a roll return of−10 percent or less, and vice versa
when it is in contango with a roll return of 10 percent or more. The Calmar
ratio over the same period as Table 5.1 is 0.55—an improvement over the
short-and-hold VX strategy, but not by much. See Figure 5.2 for the equity
curve.
There is one detail worth noting in backtesting the VX-ES strategy:
The daily settlement (closing) price of VX is obtained at 16:15 ET, while
that of ES is obtained at 16:00 ET. Since we need the roll return of VX
at its close to determine the trade signal, we cannot use the current
day’s roll return as a trading signal—we must use the lagged value. (See
VX_ES_rollreturn_lagged.m from epchan.com/book3.)

(To complicate matters further, CME, the exchange where ES is traded,
changed its settlement time for Globex equity index futures from 16:15 ET
to 16:00 ET starting November 18, 2012. See Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, 2012. I avoided any problem associated with this switchover in
the VX-ES strategy above by using the previous day’s VX price as signal.
The actual entry times of VX and ES futures may differ by 15 minutes, but
this poses no error or problem to our backtest. This fortunate situation,
however, may not extend to other strategies or other backtests that involve
arbitrage between the CME equity index futures and futures trading on
other exchanges.)
Another issue with the strategy and its backtest methodology above is that
the hedge ratio of 0.3906 between VX and ES is fixed (it was determined
based on a linear regression of their values prior to June 2010). This single
hedge ratio tends to overestimate the number of VX contracts per ES
contract when the volatility is high and likely to increase further (typically
when VX is in backwardation) and underestimate the number when the

volatility is low and likely to decrease further (typically when VX is in
contango). Hence, we can try the Kalman filter (see Chapter 3) as a dynamic
update method for the hedge ratio to see if this will improve results. To
simplify the program KF_beta_XIV_SPY.m, instead of trading VX vs. ES
futures, we trade the XIV (the ETF that tracks the inverse of the VIX) and
SPY, but otherwise the signals are the same as the VX vs. ES strategy. Of
course, in this case, we will buy XIV and short SPY when the roll return of
VX is negative, and vice versa. The hedge ratio is displayed on Figure 5.3.
Notice that since 2011 there is a general decline in volatility, which
inversely increases the value of XIV. Hence, the number of XIV shares
needed per SPY share is declining. We use the hedge ratio generated as
the output of KF_beta_XIV_SPY.m as input into the program XIV_SPY_
rollreturn_lagged.m that actually backtests the XIV vs. SPY trading strategy.
The Calmar ratio of 0.97 from November 30, 2010, to August 19, 2015,
is an improvement from 0.41 using the fixed hedge ratio to trade VX vs. ES
above over the same period. See Figure 5.4 for the equity curve.

■Predicting Volatility
If our goal is to trade volatility as in the previous section, it would be
sensible to ask how we can predict volatility. Quoting Ahmad (2005),
‘‘There are many thousands of papers on forecasting volatility using a
host of increasingly sophisticated, even Nobel-Prize-winning, statistical
techniques.’’ But for practical traders, let’s focus on the tried and true
GARCH model. (GARCH is an acronym, but the full name doesn’t
illuminate the method any better.) The model is fairly simple to describe
(see Ruppert, 2015): Predicted variance of returns is assumed to be a linear
function of past predicted variances of returns and past actual squared
returns. Supposer
t
is the log return of an underlying price series from time

be optimized by maximum likelihood estimation on in-sample data. (Note
that the definition ofpandqin Ruppert, 2015, are opposite to equation 5.1.
We adopt the convention that MATLAB uses.) Example 5.2 shows how we
can apply this method quite painlessly to predicting the volatility of SPY. To
be precise: We only want to predict whether the magnitude of the one-day
return tomorrow will be higher or lower than today’s. The resulting accu-
racy is quite high: We predicted the sign correctly better than 66 percent
of the time, out-of-sample. We can, of course, apply the same technique
to many other instruments. Here is a list, together with the out-of-sample
accuracy, based on data from November 30, 2010, to March 11, 2016:
## ■SPY: 66%
## ■USO: 67%
## ■GLD: 59%
## ■AAPL: 60%
## ■EURUSD: 62%
Why it is so easy to predict the sign of the change in volatility, but typically
so hard to predict the sign of the change in price? The answer is that it is
easy to trade on price prediction, but hard to trade on volatility prediction.
Hence, any accurate price prediction method will get arbitraged away pretty
quickly. But why is it hard to trade on volatility prediction? Didn’t we just
suggest a VX future or VXX/XIV strategy in the previous section? If we
predict that volatility will increase, why not just buy VXX, and vice versa?
Actually, if we do that, we will lose money, as Example 5.2 shows. In fact, it
is shown there that the opposite trading strategy works. The sign of change
in VXX has negative correlation with the sign of change in realized volatility!
Predicting the sign of change in realized volatility isn’t the same as predict-
ing the sign of change in VXX because a change in VXX does not represent
purely a change in implied volatility. The price of VXX reflects the value
of a portfolio of options, and option price is a function of a number of
variables, not just implied volatility. One of the most important variables
is time-to-expiration, which cannot be constant. Even if implied volatility
and all other variables are unchanged, the value of VXX or VX is still going
to decline due to negative theta. In fact, a negative theta is what’s behind the
often negative roll returns of the VX future.
(As a side note, the VIX index itself does not have theta, because the index
represents the value of a portfolio of options whose composition changes
frequently, sometimes minute to minute. As CBOE explains,
## 2
VIX is the
weighted average price of a portfolio of OTM SPX options with tenor of

23 to 37 days. There is no time decay in the collective option premium if
you can always replace an aging option with a younger one!)
Example 5.2: Predicting volatility of SPY
Since there are many numerical packages that we can use for parameter
optimization and prediction based on GARCH, we need not trouble
ourselves with the technical details. What we do need to understand
is the intuitive meaning of this equation. It allows us to predict the
magnitude of the next-period return, and it can be shown that휎
## 2
t
is the
conditional variance ofr
t
(‘‘conditional’’ because we know the previous
values of휎
## 2
t
andr
## 2
t
## ). Thus,휎
t
is none other than the predicted volatility
that we want.
To see whether this volatility prediction method is any good, let
us use the GARCH function in MATLAB’s Econometrics toolbox
## 3
to
train a model and then use it to predict the magnitude of next day’s
SPY return.
## 4
Notice that we first estimatep×q=10×9 different
GARCH models on the trainset from December 21, 2005, to Decem-
ber 5, 2011, each with a fixed value of(p,q)and a log-likelihood as an
output.
for p=1:size(PQ, 1)
for q=1:size(PQ, 2)
model=garch(p, q);
try
[∼,∼,logL] = estimate(model, ret(trainset),'print',
false);
LOGL(p, q) = logL;
PQ(p, q) = p+q;
catch
end
end
end
We then use the BIC criterion to pick the best model (i.e., the best
pandqvalues), which is the best compromise between maximizing
likelihood and preferring models with fewer parameters.
[∼, bic]=aicbic(LOGL_vector, PQ_vector+1, length(ret(trainset)));

It turns out that the best model is GARCH(1, 2). Hence, we use this
model to forecast the next day’s variance, or equivalently, the mag-
nitude of the next day’s return. We cannot, of course, expect this
forecast to be exactly the same as the next day’s return magnitude. But
from a practical viewpoint, what is important is whether thesignof
the change in magnitude of the return from one day to the next agrees
with the forecast. Hence, we compute the percent agreement on the
trainset and the test set from December 6, 2011, to November, 25,
- These turn out to be 72 percent and 69 percent, respectively,
which are very respectable numbers. Unfortunately, a straightforward
application of this to buy (sell) VXX and hold for one day when we
expect positive (negative) change in variance fails miserably. How can
our volatility prediction achieve good accuracy yet generate such poor
returns when applied to VXX?
The reason is, of course, that we succeeded only in predicting
realized volatility (as measured by the magnitude of one-day return),
but we used that to trade VXX, which is a proxy for implied volatility.
Change in realized volatility does not coincide with the change in
implied volatility, not even in the direction of the change. To see this,
let’s compute the percentage of the days where the magnitude of the
one-day returns move in the same direction as VXX, on the complete
data set from December 21, 2005, to November 25, 2015 (using
compareVolWithVXX.m). This turns out to be only 35 percent—far
less likely than random! Now, you may think this is because many of
these one-day returns may be positive, and we know that a big upward
move in the equity index is correlated with a big downward move in
implied volatility, and you would be partially right. But even if we
restrict ourselves to those days with negative equity index returns,
VXX and the return magnitude only move in the same direction
43 percent of the time. So all in all, we can conclude that realized
volatility actually moves in the opposite direction to VXX on a daily
basis!
Based on the above observation, we should be able to exploit this
fact in a trading strategy that is opposite to the one suggested before.
Whenever GARCH predicts an increase in realized volatility, we
should short VXX at the close, and vice versa. Hold only one day.
On the test set used in the GARCH model above, this strategy has a
CAGR of 81 percent, with a Calmar ratio of 1.9. The equity curve is
shown in Figure 5.5. I call it the RV(t+1)−RV(t)strategy because

If we are able to predict volatility using GARCH reasonably well,
there is an alternative trading strategy we can try. This strategy
is inspired by Ahmad (2005), who suggested that if the predicted
volatility is higher than the current implied volatility, we should buy
an option and delta-hedge until expiration. So analogously, we will
buy the front month VX future when the predicted volatility is higher
than the current VIX value, and short when the opposite occurs
(even though Ahmad, 2005, did not recommend the short trade).
We call this the RV(t+1)−VIX(t)strategy. We have shown on
Figure 5.6 the value of RV(t+1)and VIX(t) over time. We can see
that GARCH predicts a much lower volatility than VIX does during
the two financial crises in this period.
The trading strategy has a CAGR of 41.7 percent from November
30, 2010, to March 11, 2016, but with a Calmar ratio of only 0.5. The
performance has deteriorated sharply since March 2014. The equity
curve is displayed in Figure 5.7. (The backtest code can be downloaded
as VX_GARCH_VIX.m.)

■Event-Driven Strategies
Regularly scheduled market events are good candidates for volatility trading
strategies. After all, it is not easy to predict whether the Fed will increase
or decrease interest rates, or whether the unemployment numbers will be
good or bad, but it is a safe bet that there will be a larger-than-average move-
ment in prices after the announcement. The only question is: Has the option
market already priced in the expectation of volatility increase, or is there still
profit to be made? (As we learned from Example 5.2, an increase in implied
volatility does not usually accompany an increase in realized volatility.) We
will look at the evidence from one market event and see if we can build a suc-
cessful strategy around it: the ‘‘Weekly Petroleum Status Report’’ released
by the US Energy Information Administration.
The ‘‘Weekly Petroleum Status Report’’ contains supply-side statistics on
crude oil in the United States, and it often has major impact on crude oil
futures prices. This report is typically released on Wednesday mornings at
10:30 a.m. ET (for weeks that include holidays the release date is delayed
by one day and the time changed to 11:00 a.m.) The exact schedule can be
found on www.eia.gov. If one believes that the release will increase volatility
in crude oil futures, we can try buying a straddle (a call and a put at the same
strike price with the same expiration date) on them in the morning of the
release at 9:00 a.m., and sell the straddle one minute after the schedule is
released. Shockingly, this long volatility strategy loses about $27,110 per
straddle per year! Perhaps the spike of volatility is too well-anticipated by
traders, which inflates the entry price, or perhaps implied volatility once
again goes in the opposite direction from realized volatility. Since buying
implied volatility before the event isn’t successful, we may try the opposite.
But that loses even more: $36,060 per straddle per year. The reason that both
the long and short trade lost money is due to the wide bid-ask spread. We
have assumed we enter into the position using a limit order at midprice (the
average of bid and ask prices), but exit the position using a market order.
Options bid-ask spreads are notoriously wide (even for crude oil futures
ATM options with a two-week tenor, it can be as high as 1.2 percent). Hence,
the method of execution has an enormous effect on profitability. If we always
assume executions with market orders, most options strategies won’t be
profitable. But options traders do not always use market orders for position
entry. (There is no difficulty ensuring that both legs of the straddle are filled
at the same time using limit orders at entry, since CME allows traders to

## 134

## 
submit a limit order on a straddle as a single unit. In fact, we can submit any
order type to trade the straddle as a single unit.)
We can also try selling volatility during uneventful periods: We can
short a straddle at 9:00 a.m. on the dayafterthe release and buy cover it
at 10:29 a.m. on thefollowingWednesday (just before the next release).
Hopefully, this would capture the period in the week that has the least
volatility and risk. The backtest detailed in Example 5.3 shows that this
strategy does have promise: It generates a profit of $13,270 per straddle per
year, excluding commissions, with a maximum drawdown of about $4,050.
Granted, we only backtested this on one year of data, so this is very flimsy
evidence.
We can also short a strangle instead of a straddle, where the strangle
can consist of a call and a put that has a strike price, say, 5 percent out-of-
the-money (but with the same expiration date). Assuming midprice entry
and market exit, we obtain a profit of $10,640, which is comparable to the
straddle trade, but the maximum drawdown is $3,410, which is smaller than
that of the straddle.
Besides the ‘‘Weekly Petroleum Status Report,’’ there is a report
published by the American Petroleum Institute (API) that often moves the
crude oil market. This is the ‘‘API Weekly Statistical Bulletin’’ published
on Tuesdays at 4:30 p.m. ET (or Wednesdays at 4:30 p.m. if the preceding
Monday is a holiday). We can adapt the short strangle strategy to exit just
one minute before this release, and the profit is $9,750, similar to the
other variations above, but the maximum drawdown is further reduced to
## $2,950.
There are other regularly scheduled events in the futures markets that may
be exploited. One is the National Oilseed Processors Association (NOPA)
monthly crush report for soybeans that takes place at 12:00 noon ET on
the 15
th
of each month (or the next business day, if that is a holiday). We
can potentially trade the option OZS on the future ZS around that event.
Another is the US employment report issued by the Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics (BLS) every Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET (or the previous business day, if
that is a holiday). We can trade the ES option on the ES future for that. For
stock options, earnings announcements are good (and popular) candidates
for event-driven strategies.
Our trading rule is a very simplistic seasonal strategy. Interested readers
may explore refinement of this. For example, would the Calmar ratio be
higher if we short the straddle/strangle when the ratio of implied volatil-
ity over historical volatility is higher than some threshold? Should we short

it when theta is lower than some threshold so that the straddle loses value
quicker? Should we impose a stop loss or profit cap? These are variations we
are leaving as exercises.
## Example 5.3: Shorting Crude Oil Futures Options Straddles
The short crude oil futures options straddle strategy seems simple:
Just short a straddle on the day after the release date of a ‘‘US Weekly
Petroleum Status Report,’’ and buy a cover just before the next release.
But as with any options strategy, especially strategies that trade intra-
day, the implementation details can be staggering. This will be a good
example of some of the issues we face.
Crude oil futures (symbol CL) on CME Globex expire around the
## 22
th
of every month ahead of the delivery month. For example, the
February 2015 contract (denoted as CLG15 in our data and our pro-
gram) will cease trading on or around January 22, 2015. However, its
options (symbol LO) expire three (3) business days ahead. Table 5.2
offers a summary of the first and last dates that each contract will be a
candidate for trading by our strategy. Note that we trade only options
on the front (nearest to expiration) futures contract, but at the same
time we require the option to have a tenor (time-to-maturity) of about
two weeks. The option expiration date is approximate only, and the
first trading date of J12 and the last trading date of J13 are irregular
due to the limitation of our data. Furthermore, there is no guaran-
tee that this choice of tenor produces the optimal returns: It should
be treated as a parameter to be optimized. (Similarly, the exact entry
and exit dates and times are free parameters to be optimized, too.)
The data are from Nanex.net, which are time-stamped to the nearest
25 milliseconds.
The information in Table 5.2 corresponds to the values used in the
contracts, firstDateTimes, and lastDateTimes arrays in the program.
(The dateRanges array refers to the range of dates in the data files we
happen to have acquired, and have no direct correspondence to the
range of dates for each contract to be traded.)
As a straddle consists of one pair of an ATM put and call, we need
to find out what strike price is ATM at the moment of the trade entry.
Hence, we need to first retrieve the quotes data for the underlying
CL futures contracts and determine the midprice at 9:00 a.m. Eastern

Time on Thursdays. Notice that this is already a simplification: We
have treated those holiday weeks when the releases were on Thursdays
at 11:00 a.m. in the same way as the regular weeks. But if anything, this
will only deflate our backtest performance, which gives us a more con-
servative estimate of the strategy profitability. In case either a Thursday
and the following Wednesday is not a trading day, our code will take
care not to enter into a position. After finding the underlying future’s
midprice and thus the desired options strike price, we go on to retrieve
the BBO (best bid offer) quotes data for the call and put with this strike
price. This is quite a slow and tedious step, as every entry date requires
us to download two options data files.
Retrieving historical data from a data file with regularly spaced time
bars is easy, but what we have is a tick data file with quotes that may
arrive within the same 25 milliseconds, which is the time resolution
of our data. We will assume that quotes with the same time stamp are
arranged in chronological order in the file; thus, we take only the last
quote. Also, we cannot expect there is a new quote update at exactly
the entry or exit time—we will take the quotes with the most recent
time stamp just before entry or exit time as our execution prices.

natives. As for the buy cover exit, we use a market order to buy at the
ask prices. While the P&L in points is computed here just by taking the
differences between entry and exit prices (and multiplying that by−1
since this is a short position), we should remember that P&L in dollars
is one thousand (1,000) times the points difference.

■Gamma Scalping
In the previous section, we weren’t able to profit from a long option posi-
tion even when there is predictably a big price move. There are at least two
reasons why it is hard to be profitable with a long option position:
- Options can become very valuable during extreme market events (black
swans), but these events rarely happen. So most of the time we are paying
insurance premiums for nothing (as we do for, say, life insurance).
- Option premiums decay with time. The rate of change of the value of an
option with respect to time is called theta, and theta is usually negative.
However, a short option position carries the risk that when a black swan
event does occur, we will suffer a catastrophic loss. Is there a way to benefit
from being short volatility and yet be protected against extreme loss? This
motivates agamma scalpingstrategy.
In a gamma scalping strategy, we will run a mean-reversion strategy
on an underlying, taking a long position in the underlying when its price
moves lower or a short position when it moves higher. At the same time,
we will long a straddle or strangle as a hedge. As is explained in Ang
(2014), Chapter 4, a mean reversion strategy (or equivalently, a portfolio
rebalancing strategy) is short volatility, while the long straddle is, of course,
long volatility. The profit of this strategy is usually from the short-volatility,
mean-reverting strategy, while the long straddle merely provides a hedge
against extreme movements and is typically a drag on profits. (Though the

mean reversion part of the strategy is short volatility, at any moment the
static portfolio has positive vega and negative theta.)
At first glance, a long straddle combined with a long (or short) position
in the underlying would seem to result in a portfolio that would have a delta
of one (or minus one), thus fully exposed to the underlying’s movement.
(The straddle would be delta neutral, while the underlying of course has a
delta of one or minus one.) But actually, we will put on the underlying’s
position only when there is a significant movement from the strike price
of the options in the straddle. For example, if the underlying’s price sud-
denly increases significantly, the put’s delta will be almost zero (very much
OTM), while the call’s delta will be almost one (very much ITM), and enter-
ing into a short position in the underlying will render the portfolio almost
delta-neutral again. The change of the delta of the straddle per unit change
in the underlying’s price is its gamma; hence, this strategy is called gamma
scalping, as we try to profit from the changing delta by entering and exiting
the underlying’s position as its price moves up and down. (Scalpingis traders’
parlance for market making or mean reversion trading.) The more positive
the gamma of the straddle, the faster the delta changes, and the more scalp-
ing profit opportunities. Note that unlike the strategies already described,
the profit of a gamma scalping strategy ispath-dependent. It depends not only
on the initial and ending values of the underlying or the options, but on the
exact path that the underlying took from the inception time to the liquida-
tion time of the portfolio. The more often the underlying price oscillates
around some mean value, the more profit we will generate. At the same
time, unlike a typical mean reversion strategy as described in Chan (2013),
the gamma scalping strategy does not have unlimited risk. For example, if
we enter into a long position in the underlying, then if the price goes down
further, the loss of the underlying will be offset by the gain in the put posi-
tion almost exactly. Of course, if the price suddenly reverses and goes up,
the gain of underlying will more than offset the loss due to the straddle as its
delta returns to zero. This, of course, does not guarantee that a gamma scalp-
ing strategy will be profitable: If the underlying’s price changes little, the
mean reversion strategy will have nearly zero profit, while the time-decay
of the straddle’s premium, together with the probable decrease in realized
volatility (and positive vega), will generate negative P&L.
In Example 5.4, we describe the codes for the backtest of a gamma scalp-
ing strategy on crude oil futures. This strategy establishes a long straddle
position at 9:00 a.m. ET on Thursday, and liquidates everything at 2:30 p.m.
ET on Friday. The reason we pick the weekly trading period to be Thursday

morning to Friday afternoon is that the main profit driver of this strategy is
due to the mean reversion of the underlying future contract, not the long
straddle or strangle. Hence, we want to pick a period that is most favorable
to mean-reversion—that is, it is devoid of expected announcements that
might affect crude oil price. Also, we do not wish to hold positions over the
weekend, which will incur negative theta without the compensating profits
from mean reversion trading. The CL price at the inception of the straddle is
used both as the strike price of the options, as well as the mean price level for
the mean reversion strategy on the CL future. As CL goes up every 1 percent
beyond this mean price, we will short one contract, up to a maximum ofN
contracts at a maximum deviation ofN% from the mean. We will buy con-
tracts in the same way if CL goes down every 1 percent instead of up, down
to a maximum of−Ncontracts at−N% from the mean. When we enter
into a new position in CL, we assume we are using a limit order to enter at
the midprice, but if we exit an existing position, we will use a market order
to exit at the market price (as we did in the short straddle strategy before).
Nis a parameter to be optimized, as is the width of 1 percent between the
levels. To hedge a maximum ofNfutures contracts, we will buyNstraddles
at inception time.
With an arbitrarily chosenN=1, the total annual P&L of this strategy is
negative: The straddle lost a lot more than the mean reversion strategy was
able to make. If we gamma-scalp an LOstrangleinstead at 5 percent OTM,
the annual P&L is $6,370, while the maximum drawdown is at $9,400. An
improvement, though still not a great Calmar ratio. The 5 percent OTM
strangle is chosen so that any loss in the underlying for a price deviation
beyond 5 percent will be neutralized by one of the option positions. In other
words, the maximum loss of the CL position is limited to 4 percent, or
about $4,000 (assuming crude oil is worth $100 per barrel). The loss of the
strangle will, of course, be limited to the initial premium. So we are assured
that there cannot be extreme losses under any circumstances.
A less arbitrary way to fix the separation between the limit price levels
is to set it equal to the historical volatility of CL, as in the usual Bollinger
band approach. Alternatively, these price levels can be spaced based on the
delta of OTM options. For example, each leg of the strangle can be chosen
to have a delta of±0.25. Then each price level can be set equal to the strike
price of an option with delta at±0.45,±0.40,±0.35,±0.30, and±0.25.
We can also try to impose a rule that the ratio of implied volatility
to historical realized volatility must be below some threshold before we
would enter into a position. This is naturally opposite to the rule proposed

for improving the short LO straddle strategy discussed in the section
‘‘Event-Driven Strategies.’’
You may wonder if this strategy will work on stocks as well, especially
after an earnings announcement when the price has settled down to a new
level. But there is an advantage of running a gamma scalping strategy on
futures instead of stocks: Futures and their options are traded throughout
the evening (in ET) during the trading week, whereas we cannot do any
scalping on stocks or their options during those times.
Example 5.4: Gamma scalping crude oil futures with a straddle
The code for gamma scalping CL and LO is very similar to that of
shorting an LO straddle. Instead of entering into a short straddle
position, we enter into a long straddle position just before 9:00 a.m.
ET on Thursdays, assuming midprice execution, and we exit that
using market orders just before 2:30 p.m. ET on Fridays. The major
difference with shortStraddle_LO.m
## 5
is the section that deals with
the mean reversion strategy on CL. My code deals with each level
(1 percent, 2 percent,..., up to 5 percent away from the initial value
of CL) separately.
for entryThreshold=levelWidth:levelWidth:numLevels*levelWidth
exitThreshold=entryThreshold-levelWidth;
## ...
end
For each level, we determine when we enter a long or short posi-
tion, and when we exit those positions, based on whether the price
exceeds the entry threshold for that level and when it reverts toward
the initial value of CL by 1 percent. For example, for level 3, we will
buy a CL contract if the return of CL is lower than−3 percent from
the initial value, and we will hold this long position until the return of
CL increases to higher than−2 percent. At the exit time on Fridays,
we will liquidate all futures and options with market orders.

■Dispersion Trading
Dispersion trading is an arbitrage between options on stocks that are
components of an index, and the option on the index itself. It can be
understood in analogy with index arbitrage. In index arbitrage (Chan,
2013), we buy the stocks that are components of an index such as the S&P
500, and we simultaneously short the index future, or vice versa. We hope
to benefit from temporary discrepancies between market value of the stocks
and the index future. Similarly, in dispersion trading, we buy the stock
options and simultaneously short the index option—but there is no vice
versa. We usually want to short index options and seldom want to buy them
because index options are typically overpriced due to the need of portfolio
managers to protect their long index portfolios. The sale of structured
products linked to indices also increases demand for them (Bennett, 2014).
Dispersion trading is also calledcorrelation trading,since by buying the
stock component options and shorting the index option we are in effect
shorting the implied correlation of the stocks, hoping that it will converge
to the lower value of the realized correlation. (The mathematical demon-
stration of this can be found in the Bennett article as well.) When there is a
financial crisis, stocks of all stripes tend to suffer big drops at the same time.
Conversely, sometimes major macroeconomic announcements may prompt
a huge rise in market sentiment and all stocks surge. In both extremes,
stock returns experiencetail-dependence(Ruppert, 2015), as normally
uncorrelated stocks suddenly move in the same direction. These are times
where implied correlation will spike up. Naturally, if one was short implied
correlation (i.e., long stock options and short index options), one will
suffer a big loss when tail dependence hits. However, if one shorts implied
correlation after extreme events occur, one may well profit from a decrease
in correlation in the aftermath. Hence, the return-risk profile of a dispersion
or correlation trade is quite similar to that of a short VXX position that was
discussed in the section ‘‘Trading Volatility without Options.’’
A dispersion trade can be implemented by buying stock option straddles
or strangles, and shorting index option straddles or strangles. This way, the
portfolio starts off being delta-neutral. We can impose additional constraints
on the portfolio to minimize exposure to other risks. For example, if we
want to have a pure exposure to correlation decrease, and not to volatility
changes, we can make the portfolio vega-neutral by weighing the short index
option position so that its vega is equal to that of the long stock option posi-
tions. Alternatively, if we want to minimize the change of the portfolio value

due to the passage of time alone, we can make it theta-neutral also by adjust-
ing the weight of the short index option position. Our example strategy in
Example 5.5 adopts the vega-neutral weighting scheme.
Just as for index arbitrage, we often find it more profitable not to include
all the component stocks or stock options in the portfolio. Instead, we
can select a particularly favorable subset of the index components. In our
example strategy, we decide to pick the 50 stocks whose straddles have
the highest (i.e., least negative) theta in order to minimize time decay of
their premiums. Assuming that we are able to trade options at midprice,
and ignoring commissions, we find that our example strategy has a CAGR
of 19 percent (the percentage is based on the daily P&L divided by the
total gross market value of the options), a Calmar ratio of 0.4, and a
maximum drawdown of 51 percent from 2007 to the end of 2013. Another
way to measure the profit versus risk is to note the average annualized
profit is about 86 percent of the maximum drawdown in NAV (which is
different from Calmar ratio based on gross market value of the portfolio).
Surprisingly, neither the financial crisis of 2008 nor the market turmoil in
August 2011 caused much of a drawdown, despite the inevitable increase in
realized correlations. (See the equity curve in Figure 5.8.)

Our dispersion strategy rebalances the options positions at the market
close every day to ensure that the portfolio remains delta-neutral,
vega-neutral, and has maximal theta. The main challenge of generating
profits from this strategy is to avoid incurring exorbitant transaction
costs in trading options during this daily rebalance. A more cost-effective
implementation would be to delta-hedge using stocks and SPY, in the same
manner as in the gamma scalping strategy, instead of liquidating options
that are no longer ATM. Since this needs to be done for every stock in the
portfolio, it would, of course, make our already complicated backtest code
more complicated. Even with that, we won’t be able to avoid updating
option positions regularly in order to look for the maximal theta set, or
adjusting the weight of the index option to achieve vega-neutrality.
Example 5.5: Dispersion trading of SPX component
straddles vs. index straddle
Our example strategy for dispersion is to select 50 stocks within SPX
with straddles that have the highest theta at the end of each day and
buy these straddles, while shorting an SPX index straddle such that the
portfolio has zero vega. We choose only straddles closest to expiration
but with a tenor of at least 28 calendar days, and with the smallest
absolute value of delta. The maximum absolute delta allowed is 0.25
(we can’t always find a straddle with a delta of exactly zero). In case
we cannot find 50 stock straddles that fit these criteria, we may hold
positions in as few as 1 stock straddle. The index straddle must satisfy
these criteria; otherwise, no position in either stock or index option
will be held at the end of day. (Note that the previous day’s positions
are not carried over unless they are selected anew.)
We pick these stocks and options from the survivorship-bias-free
CRSP and OptionMetrics’ Ivy DB databases, respectively. The Ivy
DB database not only provides historical option prices for all the
stocks and index options, but also their Greeks. Here these data are
parsed into MATLAB binary files as they are easier to manipulate
than the original text files, since data can be stored as arrays in a
MATLAB file. Each stock symbol (more precisely, each CUSIP) has
a separate file (e.g., cusip_89235610.mat) that continues its options
data for the entire period. On the other hand, the index option data
has a separate file for each trading day (e.g., 20040102.mat) due

(For other options historical data sources,
see Chapter 1.)
Backtesting a stock options portfolio is much more complicated
than backtesting a stock portfolio due to the extra dimensions (strike
prices, expiration dates, and whether an option is a call or put)
involved. There is not sufficient memory in MATLAB to store an array
containing all the options prices of all the stocks with each dimension
corresponding to one attribute of an option. Hence, we have to read
in the data for one stock at a time and selectively store only those
data we need for the strategy. So we store only the option prices and
Greeks for various strikes for a given tenor in aT×Marray, whereT
is the total number of days and M is the total number of strike prices.
In contrast, the prices and Greeks of the index options data are stored
in 1×Marrays since we read in their data one day at a time.
After loading theseT×Marrays with option prices and Greeks into
memory, the dispersion program goes through each day in a loop and
finds all strike prices of the calls and puts of a symbol (either stock or
index)whichsatisfythetenorandnetdeltaconstraints,anddetermines
their indices in the price array. This way, we can collapse the expiration
date and strike price dimensions and achieve our needed data compres-
sion. The index that points to the location of the option data in theT×
## Marrayswiththechosenexpirationandstrikepriceisthenstoredinthe
array ATMidx(t,c, [1, 2]), wheretis time index,cis the symbol index,
and [1, 2] points to a call or put, respectively. At this point, we have
determined and stored what the eligible straddle is for one symbol. For
example, ATMidx(10, 2, 1) has a value of 101. This means that on the
## 10
th
date(20080117)andthesecondstock(CUSIP=438516106),the
bid (ask) for the call is located in row 10 and column 101 of theT×M
array ‘‘bid’’ (‘‘ask’’). The Greeks of these straddles are simultaneously
stored in arrays such as totTheta or totVega. ATMidx, totTheta, and
totVega all have dimensionT×NwhereNis the number of stocks in
the index (in contrast to theT×Marray for each stock). What we have
done so far is to compressNdata files, each with severalT×Marrays,
into fourT×Narrays, which can easily fit into memory. The following

After locating a straddle for each stock, we then go through each
day again to find the 50 of them that have the highest theta, using the
array totTheta. Next, we weigh these options by the number of shares
of underlying stocks required to contribute a market value of $1.
(To put it another way: The market value of the stocks each option
position has the right to buy or sell has a market value of $1.) We then
compute the total vega of these stock options, using the array totVega
(which, despite its name, gives the total vega for just one stock
straddle, not the total vega of all the stock straddles). The number of
options required for each stock is stored in a position arrayposwhich
also has dimensionT×N. All the stock options have positive positions.
But the index option will have a negative position with a vega equal to
the negative of the total vega of the stock positions. Here is the code
fragment for that:

(An alternative capital allocation among the stock options is to
weigh them by the number of shares of underlying stocks required to
contribute to their index weight. For example, if AAPL contributes
3.8 percent to the SPX, and we assume the stock portfolio is worth
$500, we need to compute the number of shares of AAPL that have
the market value $3.80, and divide this by 100 as the number of AAPL
straddles to buy.)
After computing the number of straddles we need on each side,
we can proceed to compute the P&L of holding these positions.

Finally, we can also compute the gross market value of these positions
by multiplying the number of straddles by their call and put prices
and summing across all stocks and index straddles. This way, we can

though a call option price will drop on the dividend ex-date, unlike
stock, there will be no compensating dividend payout so this is a real

loss, and thus no historical adjustment is needed. Owners of a call
would typically sell it before ex-date. We, however, do not take into
account the need to sell a call before dividend ex-date in this strategy.
(The same argument applies to puts.) On the ex-date for a split, option
price do not change, but each option will be the right to buy or sell
a different number of shares based on the split factor. For example,
if it is a two-for-one split, a call option that was issued prior to the
ex-date would allow you to buy 200 shares instead of 100 on or after
the ex-date. Since the option price doesn’t change, there is no need for
historical adjustment, either.
■Cross-Sectional Mean Reversion
of Implied Volatility
One of the advantages of being an algorithmic options trader is the abil-
ity to choose among a large portfolio of stock options to find the ones that
have the ‘‘best’’ prices. But what does the best price mean for options?
Clearly, it doesn’t just mean that an option is cheap: OTM options are always
cheaper than ATM or ITM options, and options with shorter tenors are
always cheaper than those with longer tenors, but that doesn’t mean they
have better value. Instead, we may measure the ‘‘cheapness’’ of an option by
its implied volatility. If it has the lowest implied volatility of all the options
for the same underlying, we may consider it the ‘‘cheapest.’’ But even if an
option is cheap, it doesn’t necessarily mean that we should buy it: We would
only do so if we think its price is going to mean-revert.
Notice I didn’t say that we should only buy an option if its price is going
to ‘‘increase.’’ There are two types of mean reversion: time-series and
cross-sectional. Time-series mean reversion in this context means that we
expect a cheap option will indeed increase in price later on. This has to be
an unusual occurrence, though: As we know, option prices tend to decrease
due to the decay of time value. A cheap option will increase in price only in
the unusual situation that expectation of future realized volatility increases
significantly. Another way to look at this is that a low implied volatility may
indeed increase later on, but this doesn’t mean that the option’s price will
increase. However, in cross-sectional mean reversion, we do not require
that an option will increase in price in theabsolutesense. We only require
that it will increase in price in arelativesense: that it will become more
expensive relative to other options of the same underlying and perhaps

the same tenor. In other words, we expect that the price difference between
an option with the lowest implied volatility and its peers with higher
implied volatility will narrow over time, and might even change sign.
Of course, the earlier discussion concerning the cheapest option applies
in an opposite way to an ‘‘expensive’’ option, too. In cross-sectional mean
reversion of option prices, we would expect a relatively expensive option to
become relatively cheaper.
Do cross-sectional mean reversions actually occur regularly? We can
easily find out by constructing a trading strategy that should be profitable
(at least in a backtest) if this is true. We start with the S&P 500 universe.
Every day and for every stock in the universe, just as in the dispersion
strategy, we select a slice of options that have the nearest expiration date
but that have a tenor of at least 28 calendar days. We select the call option
with the lowest implied volatility among them and add it to a candidate list
of call options. Similarly, we select the put option with the highest implied
volatility and add it to a candidate list of put options. After going through
all the stocks in the universe, we form a long portfolio of 50 call options
by choosing the ones with the lowest implied volatilities from the call
option candidate list. Similarly, we form a short portfolio of 50 put options
by choosing the ones with the highest implied volatilities from the put option
candidate list. We will hold all these options positions for just one day, and
rebalance the portfolio as necessary on the following day’s market close.
Naturally, due to put-call parity, we can just as well implement this strat-
egy by shorting calls and buying puts instead. (Put-call parity is only exactly
true for European options. But with the risk-free rate so low, it is almost true
for American options, too, especially for the short-tenor ones we choose.)
The implementation of this backtest is structurally similar to that of
the dispersion strategy, and the program is available for download as
impVolCrossSectionalMeanReversion.m. The backtest of this strategy
achieved an astoundingdailyreturn of 1.1 percent from 2007 to the
end of 2013, without subtracting commissions, and assuming midprice
executions. There are several reasons why the return is so high, and may be
unrealistic. Unlike the dispersion trading strategy before, we don’t insist
on using ATM options in this strategy. OTM options tend to have higher
embedded leverage, and since the return we quote is the P&L of an option
position divided by its market value, it is essentially a levered return that
will go up with leverage.
(Leverage is calculated as delta times the price of the underlying divided
by the price of its option. Figure 5.9 shows the leverages of puts and

calls of AAPL as a function of strike price. Either leverage is evidently a
monotonically increasing function of strike price, but the absolute values of
the leverages are increasing as a function of the options’ out-of-moneyness.
Since delta for puts is negative, their leverage is also negative. The code to
generate this curve can be downloaded from computeLeverage.m.)
OTM options also tend to be less liquid and have wider bid-ask spread.
Our backtest assumes midprice executions, which may be unrealistic when
the bid-ask spread is wide. Strategies often have high returns on paper when
those returns cannot actually be captured in live trading due to high trans-
action costs, which may be the case here. Nevertheless, the highly positive
theoretical return illustrates that cross-sectional mean reversion of implied
volatility does occur regularly.
What about the risk of this mean reversion strategy? Since we are long
calls and short puts, we are certainly not market or delta neutral. This
can easily be remedied by delta hedging the portfolio with a short SPY
position. We will leave that as an exercise to see if it reduces the maximum
drawdown. But even after delta-hedging this portfolio, it is still short vega,

since we are short options with high implied volatility and long options with
low implied volatility. Might this strategy work with just the long side, thus
eliminating vega risk? Or can we weigh the long and short options positions
to enforce vega-neutrality, just as in dispersion trading? We will leave all
that to you to explore.
■Summary
It isn’t easy to profit from buying options unless one is Nassim Nicholas Taleb
(Chung, 2015). Even when we think realized volatility will go up due to
expected events (‘‘Event-Driven Strategies’’ section), we end up extracting
returns only in the aftermath by shorting volatility. Even though we bought
straddles in the ‘‘Gamma Scalping’’ section, we were only able to profit from
the mean reversion trading of the underlying, which is short volatility. At
best, we were able to be vega-neutral in the ‘‘Dispersion Trading’’ section.
But by shorting correlation there, we were exposed to the same tail risks
as shorting volatility. In the section on ‘‘Cross-Sectional Mean Reversion of
Implied Volatility,’’ we actively sought options with high implied volatili-
ties and short them, though we hedged by buying those options with low
implied volatilities. We were still net short implied volatility as a result. We
were acting like an insurance company in these trades. Even though Taleb
is celebrated for his ability to earn 20 percent in one day during market
crashes, one should note that his year-to-date return was also 20 percent,
since the long volatility makes practically nothing until that day. A short
volatility strategy (like the FX mean reversion strategy we run in our fund)
is able to earn more than 20 percent in a year, though one will have to suf-
fer steep drawdown during risk-off periods. It is therefore not surprising to
hear expert options traders saying that they spend most of their time shorting
options (Chan, 2015).
If we are to sell volatility, we might as well find the most efficient and least
risky way to do it. That is why various different short volatility strategies
are explored. With the aid of a computer, even independent traders are not
limited to just trading a few familiar options. They can choose among a port-
folio of hundreds of different options, with different underlyings, tenors,
and strike prices and select the most advantageous ones to hold positions.
Of course, it is quite complicated to backtest such high-dimensional strate-
gies. The main problem is that storing high dimensional arrays in memory
is not feasible in most common programming languages. We demonstrated

how to get around this problem using special programming structures in
the ‘‘Dispersion Trading’’ and ‘‘Cross-Sectional Mean Reversion of Implied
Volatility’’ sections.
But these backtests are only suggestive—they can’t really tell us whether
the strategies will be profitable in live trading. The reason for such tenta-
tiveness is the especially large bid-ask spreads of options compared to their
underlyings. (We saw that even an option on a very liquid future like CL
can have a bid-ask spread that is over 1.2 percent wide.) The strategies were
mostly backtested by assuming that we can enter a position at midprice. In a
few cases, we even assume that we can exit a position with midprice. This is
not an impossible pipe dream, as options traders do manually and expertly
adjust their limit prices so that they get filled without paying the full-spread,
taking into account the instantaneous condition of the order book and order
flow. But this is often an art rather than science. The science of balancing the
opportunity cost (for not getting filled) and bid-ask cost can be explored only
if one has an options trading simulator, or of course in live trading. Hence,
a sophisticated automated market-making program is necessary to execute
many of these strategies.
I did describe in the sections on ‘‘Trading Volatility without Options’’ and
‘‘Predicting Volatility’’ some pseudo-options strategies that can both long
and short the ETF VXX or the future VX at different times. They are far
easier to backtest and execute than the strategies that really trade stock or
even index options themselves.
You are no doubt aware that there are many more options strategies out
there than the ones covered in this chapter, involving structures such as but-
terflies, condors, ladders, and so on. Hopefully, the techniques introduced
here will allow you to automatically search for the best structure among the
hundreds or thousands of choices every day, or every millisecond.
■Exercises
5.1. What is the sign of the vega for SPX options? How do you reconcile
this sign with the fact described in Exercise 5.2 that implied volatility
seems to anticorrelate with realized volatility on a daily basis?
5.2. Backtest various refinements of the trading rules suggested at the end
of ‘‘Event-Driven Strategies.’’
5.3. Assuming a CL contract is initially quoted at 100, demonstrate that
the maximum loss of the mean reversion strategy on CL described in
‘‘Gamma Scalping’’ is $4,000 for holding one contract. (The maxi-
mum loss here does not include the options premium.)

uppose you are given a choice of two investment strategies. Both have
the same unlevered average annualized returns net of all costs, but one
has an average holding period of one hour and the other has a holding period
of one month. Which strategy would you prefer?
Most investors would prefer the first, intraday strategy. The reason
is obvious: intraday strategies typically have higher Sharpe ratio than
longer-term ones, given the same average returns. This is because intraday
strategies can make more independent bets in one day. By the law of large
numbers, the difference between an intraday strategy’s realized mean return
and expected return will be smaller than that of a strategy that makes only
monthly bets. Because of the higher Sharpe ratio, we can also apply a higher
leverage to the strategy as per Kelly’s formula. So even if the unlevered
average returns of the two strategies are the same, the levered compound
return of the intraday strategy will be higher.
## 1
Quite apart from earning
higher returns, it is also obvious that the longer one holds a position, the
more vulnerable we are to black swan risks.
So why don’t we all become day traders, or taking this to the extreme,
high frequency traders? First, there is the issue of capacity. If you are a
billionaire (or manager of a billion-dollar fund), it is almost impossible to

find a day trading strategy that can generate significant returns on your asset.
For example, even AAPL has an average daily trading volume of only about
$4 billion. Worse, the average top-of-book quote size for AAPL at Nasdaq
is only 189 shares (Cartea, Jaimungal, and Penalva, 2015, Table 4.7). A day
trading strategy cannot have orders that are much bigger than the quote size
## ‘‘at-the-touch’’
## 2
without having major market impact that destroys any the-
oretical profit (though using dark pools can alleviate part of this problem,
as we shall see.) Of course, you might consider trading stock index futures
instead, which is even more liquid than AAPL. But even the ES future for
the S&P 500 stock index has an at-the-touch quote size of about $30 mil-
lion only. If we submit a market order that approaches $1 billion, we will
instantly ‘‘walk the book’’ (take out multiple layers of the order book).
But even if one does not have a billion dollars to deploy, intraday traders
still need to worry a lot about transaction costs that may comprise of
bid-offer spread, slippage, market impact, adverse selection, opportunity
cost, and so on. To understand transaction costs and how best to minimize
them, we need to understand better what is generally calledmarket
microstructurein the academic literature. Part of this chapter is intended to
be a primer on this topic, which includes the study of latency reduction,
smart routing, market fragmentation, optimal order types, and dark pools.
But beyond such execution issues, just backtesting intraday strategies
involves some subtle issues that can significantly affect their accuracy. We
will discuss various problems with supposedly high frequency data for
such backtests. Fortunately, not everything is toil and trouble in intraday
trading. We will discuss some research that uses order flow and order book
information for high frequency trading.
Most of the discussion in this chapter focuses on the US stock market,
since microstructure issues are most complex there. However, we will com-
ment on relevant issues in the US futures and spot currency markets as well.
■Latency Reduction
There are three types of latencies we have to contend with in trading:
- Order submission: The time between our submitting an order, and the
order’s arrival at the market venue.
- Order status: The time between the execution (full or partial) or cancel-
lation/rejection/modification of our order and our receipt of the order
status notification.

## INTRADAY TRADING AND MARKET MICROSTRUCTURE
## 
## 
## 161
## 
## 
- Market data: The time between the occurrence of a tick on a market
venue and our reception of that tick. (A tick can be an execution or a
change of a quote on that market.)
Whatever latency is, common sense tells us that it can’t be good for trad-
ing. For example, if having your order execute just a few milliseconds later
will be beneficial, we could have just submitted it a few milliseconds later.
Reducing latency is an important part of reducing execution costs. We will
discuss how to minimize each type of latency in this section.
In this era of low-cost colocation, even retail traders can easily reduce
the order submission latency to below 5 milliseconds (ms) in some cir-
cumstances. For example, you can rent a virtual private server at Equinix’s
NY4 data center in Secaucus, New Jersey, through Fluid Hosting for
hundreds of dollars a month, and cross-connect (for some extra hundreds
of dollars) to Interactive Brokers’ (IB) Point of Presence (POP) there.
Alternatively, you can rent a virtual private server at DuPont Fabros’s NJ1
data center in Piscataway, New Jersey, through Speedy Trading Servers
(www.speedytradingservers.com) for a much lower price, which has an
extranet connection with IB’s Stamford, Connecticut, trading servers.
Either option will get your order to IB below 5 ms. Of course, IB will then
reroute your order to various exchanges such as the NYSE, Nasdaq, or
Globex, unless you are trading currencies in which case your order is imme-
diately routed to IB’s FX liquidity partners that include various global banks.
The rerouting time from IB to an exchange is, however, quite fast. You can
beat IB’s time-to-market only if you pay huge sums of money to invest in
microwave or laser transmissions, and if you meet the necessary capital
requirement for your brokerage account (which can be as low as several hun-
dred thousand dollars for currency trading) to opt for direct ‘‘sponsored’’
access to the various market centers. In this scenario, you will be collocated
at the market center itself, and your order goes directly from your program
to the market without going through your broker’s server. You will need a
prime broker to provide you with credit for such sponsored access.
If you have minimized the latency of submitting an order, then you
have also minimized the latency of receiving an order status confirmation,
whether your order has been filled, cancelled, or otherwise modified. Just
as in the case of order submission, we are also at the mercy of the broker,
unless we have direct sponsored access to the market venue. The time it
takes for your order to be transmitted to the market is usually similar to the
time it takes for the order status to be transmitted back to you.

Market data latency, however, is a whole different matter. Most brokers
(except FX brokers, since they often run their own FX market) do not
bother to provide you with low-latency market data. This is not their core
competency. For example, IB provides snapshots of stock prices at 250 ms
intervals only. (The IB latency for futures, and option-on-futures, data is
the same as for stocks. But for stock options it is 10 ms, and for FX, just
5 ms). In fact, there are very few market data providers that can offer
stocks and futures data with lower than 10 ms latency—among them, S&P
Capital IQ (previously QuantHouse), SR Labs, and Thomson Reuters are
some examples. However, one should prepare to pay dearly (i.e., a few
thousand dollars per month) for such data feeds. Of course, one can also
subscribe to the market venues’ data feed directly. Nasdaq, for example,
offers the ITCH feed which has a lot more information beyond price and
size (more on this later) besides being low latency. Such an enriched, direct
data feed from the market venues is generally much more expensive than
the consolidated data feeds distributed by SIP,
## 3
unless one is subscribing to
a ‘‘Managed’’ version that a broker may provide to its clients.
## 4
All the latencies we have described so far concerned the time of travel
of data. But of course, there is also the issue of computational latency—the
time it takes your trading program to turn market data into trading deci-
sions. As we saw in Chapter 1, many programming languages can turn a
trading strategy into an automated execution platform that can receive mar-
ket data and submit an order through a broker or an exchange API, but they
differ greatly in speed. In a nutshell, complied languages such as C++,C#,
or Java generally run at least 10 times faster than scripting languages such
as MATLAB, R, or Python (Aruoba, Bora
## ̆
gan, and Fernández-Villaverde,
2014), and so we should use only compiled languages for intraday trading.
However, there are ways to replace computationally intensive functions in a
scripting language with compiled codes. If we use Mex files written in C++
for such functions in MATLAB, or if we use Numba or Cython compilers
for Python, then their speed comes within a factor of 2 of that of C++. The
speed of R, however, cannot yet be increased to match these.
If one doesn’t want to write automated execution platforms using uni-
versal languages such as C++or MATLAB, one can use the special-purpose
trading platforms such as Deltix, Progress Apama, and S&P Capital IQ’s
Quanthouse. Though their speed may not be as fast as custom-built C++
codes, their performance won’t be too different from compiled scripting
languages.
Latency affects transaction costs in two distinct ways, depending on
whether one is running a mean-reversion or a momentum strategy.

We usually execute a mean-reversion strategy by placing limit orders on
the order book. If our placement is a few milliseconds later than our com-
petitors’ (other mean reversion traders or market makers), the opportunity
for our order to get filled may be lost. That is because most order books
use time priority
## 5
to decide which order will get filled first, for orders
at the same prices. In other words, we may sufferopportunity costdue to
latency. For high-frequency traders who provide liquidity in order to earn
rebates provided by some exchanges, this opportunity cost can be measured
quite precisely. In addition to opportunity cost, latency also inducesadverse
selection. That is to say, one’s limit orders only get filled when the market
goes against us immediately after execution. For example, if we place a buy
limit order, we may only get filled when the price drops after the execu-
tion. This is often because the counterparties who sent market-sell orders
to execute against our limit-buy orders are more informed traders, who only
send out these market orders when they can accurately predict that prices
will soon drop. If we have lower latency than other traders (including both
market makers and informed traders), and if we are also good at predicting
the short-term price movement, we may be able to cancel or modify our
limit orders before they get adversely executed against. Even if we do not
possess this predictive ability but enjoy the lowest latency, we can at least
hope that the profits we earn from frequently providing liquidity due to our
head-of-queue status will offset the losses when there are adverse executions.
If we are momentum traders, we are the informed party in such
transactions. In order to immediately benefit from our information, we
have to use market orders. Latency in our market orders getting executed
will result in slippage—other informed traders may have already taken
the quotes with better prices a few milliseconds before us. Note that
here we use ‘‘information’’ in the broadest possible sense. Naturally, we
include information such as news and fundamental analysis. But we also
include predictions that come from quantitative or technical analysis.
■Order Type and Routing Optimization
Now that we have configured our trading infrastructure with the lowest
physical latency, we need to consider what sort of order types best achieve
our goals within the shortest time and the lowest cost. Once again, we
have to distinguish between mean-reversion (liquidity-providing, market-
making) strategies, and momentum (liquidity/market-taking) strategies.
Note that this section pertains only to US stocks trading, and the special
order types discussed are mainly of interest to traders with institutional

prime broker accounts (though retail traders may be able to access these
through a membership in a proprietary trading firm).
## Adding Liquidity
The prototypical order type for a mean-reverting strategy is the limit
order. But the problem with a plain-vanilla limit order is that it is difficult
to compete in priority with the limit orders with special modifiers that
many high-frequency traders use for US stocks. These special modifiers can
push a limit order to the head of the queue in execution priority, so they
have the best chance of getting filled ahead of everybody else and enjoy
the exchange’s rebate of about 1 to 3 mils
## 6
per share (as well as possibly
earning the bid-ask spread as all market-making strategies are supposed to).
One of these modifiers is generically calledhide-and-light. Examples of the
hide-and-light order are Hide Not Slide Order on BATS, and Post No Pref-
erence Blind Order on NYSE ARCA (see Mackintosh, 2014; Nasdaq, 2014;
and DirectEdge, 2015). To understand how a hide-and-light limit order
works, one has to understand a bit about the US stock market structure.
There isn’t one US stock market—there are more than 50 of them. Eleven
or so of these market centers are exchanges, and the rest are dark pools.
As a result, the US stock market is very fragmented, and when you submit a
limit order to your broker, it is quite difficult to figure out to which market
center it will be routed (unless your broker allows you to directly route
to a specific market center: the so-called Direct Market Access, or DMA).
Each market center maintains its own order book. But these order books are
not totally independent—they are governed by a rule established by the SEC
around 2007, called the Order Protection Rule (Rule 611) of the Regulation
National Market System (Reg NMS). The gist of this rule is that any arriving
market order (or marketable limit order) must be routed to the exchange
with the bestdisplayedquote where the order can be filled. (Only exchanges
but not dark pools will have displayed quote.) The best displayed quotes
across all the exchanges are called the NBBO (National Best Bid Offer), and
the best displayed quotes (BBO) on each of these exchanges are ‘‘protected’’
by the Order Protection Rule, in the sense that their prices must be checked
by all the exchanges to determine where an order should be routed.
Suppose a stock has best bid offer of $10-10.02 at exchange L (some
‘‘local’’ exchange) and best bid offer of $10-10.01at exchange N (the
exchange that has the National best offer). Assume the quote sizes are all for
100 shares (see Table 6.1). Now if a trader sends a limit buy order for 100
shares at $10.01 to exchange L, it will not stay there. It has to be routed

to N and will be immediately executed there as a market order against the
National Best Offer (NBO), which is noted inboldface. If the intention of
the trader is to earn a rebate from the exchange L, this execution as market
order is bad because the trader will instead be charged a liquidity taking fee
by N. However, if we specify this limit buy order as a hide-and-light order,
then the exchange will automatically lower its display limit price to $10 so
that it can stay on its order book, while remembering that it has a hidden
working price of $10.01. If and when the national best offer is raised to
$10.02, then the display price of this order will also be automatically lifted
to $10.01, which is now the national best bid. This change of limit price
is managed by the exchange itself, requiring no further instruction from
the trader—hence, it has practically zero latency. More importantly, it
was time-stamped at the original time that the order was received by the
exchange, not at the time that the order was repriced at $10.01, and hence
it has higher priority over all other orders (except an ISO order, which we
will discuss later). Therefore it is very likely that this order will be executed
and the trader will earn the liquidity rebate.

Now you may wonder how one can be so sure that the national best offer
would be lifted from $10.01 to $10.02 shortly after the trader placed the
hide-and-light order. There is one way to be sure: See into the future. What
I mean is that the trader can use the fast direct data feed from the exchanges
mentioned in the section on ‘‘Latency Reduction’’ to see whether the offer
has been raised to $10.02 before placing the hide-and-light order. Note that
the NBBO is based on the slower SIP data feed, which is about 0.5 ms slower
than the direct feed. (Ding, 2014. See also Hunsader, 2016(1) and (2).)
So even if the offer has actually been raised at exchange N to $10.02, anyone
placing a limit buy order at $10.01 will still be routed to exchange N, only to
findthatitwillbesittingatthetopoftheorderbookatNsometime(0.5ms?)
afterthe hide-and-light order has already been placed at the top of book at
exchange L at the same price. Therefore, placing a hide-and-light order is
one way to increase the chance that the order will be at the head of the queue.
The exchange L benefits from providing such exotic order types to
high-frequency traders because they will get to keep the limit orders local
(instead of routing them to N) and earn exchange fees when market orders
get routed to its NBBO for executions. Higher volume at an exchange will
also attract more orders, begetting higher volume, and so on. Finally, more
volume at an exchange means that more traders will pay them high market
data fees for their direct feeds. To an exchange, this is one big profitable
virtuous circle.
Unfortunately, retail brokerages do not make available the hide-and-light
order to their customers, since retail brokerages do not allow their
customers to have direct sponsored access to the market centers. The
hide-and-light order is only useful if you can submit it to the exchange faster
than the latency of the SIP feed as explained above, which is just 0.5 ms or
so. Even if by some good luck, your limit order did end up getting filled,
some retail brokerages still would not pass on the exchange rebates to
you. Instead, they simply pocket them. Only select retail brokers such as
Interactive Brokers, and institutional brokers such as Lime Brokerage, will
pass on the rebates. So the hide-and-light order type is really useful only if
you are trading for an account large enough that can be served by a prime
broker or if you are trading your membership account of a proprietary
trading firm.
If getting head-of-queue priority for our limit order is the goal, and we
have information from our fast direct market data feed that tells us where the
NBO will be in the next millisecond, then there is another order type that
is useful—the intermarket sweep order (ISO). Thankfully, this order type
is sometimes available

to retail investors.

The ISO is also a type of limit order. But unlike an ordinary limit order,
a buy ISO need not be routed to the market center that has the National
Best Offer (we called it market N), even if its limit price is equal to the
NBO. The sender of this order is supposed to separately send another buy
ISO to execute against the NBO and remove that quote. This is easy enough
to accomplish, because, as we mentioned in this chapter’s introduction, the
NBBO quote size is often quite small. The original ISO will be allowed to
sit at the top of the order book of the local market center L as the best bid
(see an illustration of this in Table 6.2). As in the case of the hide-and-light
order, we may choose to do this only when we know via the fast direct
data feed that the actual best offer at N is higher than the NBO. So when
the SIP feed finally broadcasts the new, higher NBO to everybody, our bid
at L will be the National Best Bid (NBB) and is at head-of-queue. In fact,
because no repricing of the order is needed here, our bid has even higher
priority than the hide-and-light order in the queue.
There are reasons other than earning rebates that make it advantageous
to use the hide-and-light or the ISO orders. As already mentioned, get-
ting our limit orders filled more frequently reduces adverse selection.
(Otherwise, we may only get filled in a trending market.) Also, in this era of
high-frequency trading, prices change very quickly but order routing takes
time. So by the time an order is routed to the exchange with the NBBO, it
might no longer be the best price. (Some exchanges actually charge a fee to
liquidity providers, and pay a rebate to liquidity takers. See Box 6.1 for an
example.)

Box 6.1: Why does BATS’ BZX exchangechargefees
for adding liquidity?
The concept that a trader will earn a rebate for adding (making) liquid-
ity, and will be charged a fee for taking liquidity (the ‘‘maker/taker’’
model), is familiar. For example, BATS’ BYX exchange pays a rebate of
0.18 cents per share (also called 1.8mils) for adding liquidity (placing
a limit order on its order book that is not immediately executable and
is executed later against an incoming marketable order), and charges
0.15 cents per share for taking liquidity (sending an order to it that is
immediately executed against a resting order). However, BATS’ BZX
exchange does the opposite: It charges a fee of 0.20 cents for adding
liquidity, and pays a rebate of 0.30 cents for taking liquidity (see
www.batstrading.com/support/fee_schedule). This seems bizarre
at first sight, but the reason for sending a limit order to BZX is to
gain head-of-queue priority for execution, though obviously not
for rebate-earning purpose. It is for those mean-reversion traders
that are able to earn liquidity-providing profits through other means
(such as the many mean-reversion trading models I described in this
and my previous books). By charging a fee, this exchange essentially
discourages those HFT rebate-seekers from getting in front of us
old-fashioned statistical arbitrageurs. It relieves us from engaging in
such high-tech weaponry as using hide-not-slide orders or ISO, which
are typically not available to traders without prime broker sponsored
direct access to trade on exchanges. For another explanation, see
## Hasbrouck (2014).
## Taking Liquidity
When we are the informed traders, we want our orders to execute quickly,
lest other informed traders executed ahead of us and drive prices away.
A good old-fashioned market order would seem to fit our need here. How-
ever, the market order has one problem—it will have to be routed to the
exchange with the NBBO. As we saw above, an uncertain fate meets our
order once it arrives there: The NBBO might not actually be the best price
available in the market. If we have a direct market data feed, we may know
better where to send our order. But we still need to ensure that the exchange
to which we send our order will not be obligated (as a result of the Order

Protection Rule) to reroute it to the exchange with the official, though not
actual, NBBO. The best way to do this is to use the Intermarket Sweep Order
we just discussed. There is one difference from our previous usage of the
ISO—our limit price for a buy ISO order will be set higher than the best
offer at the local exchange L, so that execution is immediate. ISOs are exe-
cuted faster than non-ISOs even without routing, because the exchange to
which the ISO is sent does not need to spend time checking the protected
quotes of other exchanges before executing it.
Another circumstance where an ISO is warranted is when our order size
is bigger than the NBBO size. If we didn’t apply the ISO modifier, part of
the order not filled by the top-of-book quote may be rerouted to another
exchange that has the best price after the original NBBO quote is filled by
our order. But again, any rerouting causes latency, and when the market is
moving fast due to breaking news, prices may have changed adversely after
our partial order arrives at the new exchange. Adding the ISO modifier will
allow the order sent to the local exchange L to ‘‘walk’’ the book—that is, fill
the entire order against quotes on L by sweeping several layers of the order
book, without routing any part to the exchange with the official NBBO. In
fact, if we have a large market order, and if we know the order books of
several exchanges, we might send multiple ISOs to the individual exchanges
simultaneously to take advantage of their instantaneous liquidity. In other
words, ISO allowsparallel processinginstead ofsequential processingof our
large order, reducing the chance that HFT can sniff out our order trail and
front-run us (see Example 6.1).
Example 6.1: How ISOs walk a book
Suppose we have only three exchanges, with their order books for a
stock shown below (only bids are relevant for this example):

The ‘‘protected’’ quote sizes are inboldface. Note that N1 has the
NBB. A trader sends ‘‘sell 300 limit $10.00 ISO’’ to L. In order to
satisfy the Order Protection Rule, the trader needs to send separately
to N1 a ‘‘sell 100 limit $10.00 ISO’’ to N1. The first ISO sent to L
will then walk the book and sell 100 shares at $10.02 and 200 shares
at $10.00. But this last trade could have been done at a better price of
$10.01 on N1.
Does the Order Protection Rule require the exchange L to route a
sell order of 200 shares to N1 after it executes the first 100 shares at
$10.02? The answer is no: The 300 shares at $10.01 on N1 is not a
protected quote, since it is not at the top of book on N1.
Does the Order Protection Rule require the trader to send an ISO
to N2? The answer is also no: The protected quote at N2 does not have
asuperiorprice to the limit price of the first ISO, so no routing would
be needed. As SEC Rule 300(30)(ii) says, ‘‘Simultaneously with the
routing of the limit order identified as an intermarket sweep order, one
or more additional limit orders, as necessary, are routed to execute
against the full displayed size of any protected bid, in the case of a
limit order to sell,..., for the NMS stock with a price that issuperior
[emphasis added] to the limit price of the limit order identified as an
intermarket sweep order. These additional routed orders also must be
marked as intermarket sweep orders.’’ (See Hasbrouck, 2014, p. 24.)
Suppose that after the ISO was sent, but before it was executed,
N2’s NBB was increased to $10.03. The trader still would not need to
send an order to N2 immediately to satisfy the Order Protection Rule.
As Wood, Upson, and McInish (2013), explained, ‘‘Execution of ISOs
are based on the state of the market at order submission and are [sic]
not impacted by changes in the market state during processing.’’
To ensure that our limit ISO will behave like a market order, and not end
up as a resting limit order on the book if there is not enough liquidity on
the book to execute against it, we can add the immediate-or-cancel (IOC)
modifier to it. This way, the unexecuted part of the limit IOC will simply be
canceled. As we will discuss in the section on ‘‘Adverse Selection,’’ adding
the an IOC modifier is generally a good way to prevent adverse selection
against a limit order.
(An IOC modifier can be applied to a market order, too. In this case, the
market order will similarly not be routed to the exchange with a protected

quote that has a better price than the quotes at the local exchange. But it also
won’t be allowed to execute against quotes that are not NBBO at L. Instead,
it will be cancelled after executing the portion that matches with an NBBO
quote. See Exercise 6.2.)
Simply put, latency is bad for informed traders, rerouting causes latency,
and using ISO can avoid rerouting. And apparently, because only professional
traders use ISO, order flow (a concept to be discussed later in a separate
section) generated by an ISO has more information content than order flow
from ordinary market order (Chakravarty, Jain, Wood, and Upson, 2009).
While ISO sounds like a very useful way to get our order to the
head-of-queue as described in the subsection ‘‘Adding Liquidity,’’ or to
quickly capture liquidity as described in this subsection, it may have some
unpleasant side effects. It has been blamed as a cause of ‘‘flash crashes’’ or
‘‘mini flash crashes’’ (Golub, Keane, and Poon, 2012). The most famous
flash crash occurred on May 6, 2010, but there have been many mini flash
crashes in individual stocks both before and after that. One definition of
a flash crash (assuming a downward crash in prices) is that the stock ticks
down at least 10 times, and this ticking down happens within 1.5 seconds,
and the price change exceeds−0.8 percent. (A symmetrical definition
applies to an up crash.) One can see that an ISO can cause such crashes, since
it is allowed to walk the book at an exchange despite the possible existence
of better quotes elsewhere. Those better quotes are not ‘‘protected’’ by
the Order Protection Rule, since they are not the BBO at that exchange,
and there is no need for any order to be routed to them. But a large but
ordinary market order can also walk the book, except that a small portion
of it will be routed by the local exchange to the exchange with the NBBO.
So it is not cleara prioriwhether ISOs or market orders are the cause of
flash crashes. Only after a careful examination by Golub, Keane, and Poon
(2012), have they determined that fully 71.49 percent of them are caused
by ISO.
Routing to Dark Pools
Dark pools are market centers that do not display any of their quotes—
traders can submithiddenorders to them. But just like any market center,
they do have to report their trades after execution.
## 8
There are over 40 dark
pools for stocks in the United States. Examples of dark pools are Goldman
Sachs’s Sigma X, ITG’s POSIT, and formerly IEX.
## 9
Not all hidden orders
reside on dark pools—they can reside on any of the 11 or so exchanges

discussed above. But an order sent to a dark pool is unique in that it will
usually be executed at the midprice within the NBBO, and thus only the side
(buy or sell) and size but not limit price are attached to such an order. On
some dark pools, traders can agree to pay a premium above/below midprice
for priority executions (see Nimalendran and Ray, 2011), and on others,
traders can specify ‘‘price protection.’’ Price protection specifies the worst
price at which an order can get executed. When an order arrives at a dark
pool, and there is no unexecuted (resting) order on the opposite side, the
order will rest in the pool, undisplayed. (Similarly, if the aggregate resting
order is smaller in size than the incoming order, the unexecuted part of the
incoming order will rest in the pool.) Whenever an opposite order arrives,
part or all of the unexecuted resting orders will get filled at the NBBO mid-
price. A typical dark pool will allocate these fills on a pro rata basis, not on
a time priority basis (Hasbrouck, 2015). For example, if trader A has a buy
order for 1,000 shares resting on the dark pool, and trader B has a buy order
for 2,000 shares resting, and there is an incoming sell order of 1,500 shares,
then 500 shares of A’s order and 1,000 shares of B’s order will be filled.
If we are an informed trader (in the special sense that we have been using),
there is a big advantage in sending an order to a dark pool instead of sending
a market order, or a limit IOC order, to a lit market. The first reason is
obvious: The execution at a dark pool will save us half the NBBO spread
compared to a market order. The second reason is also easy to understand.
If we send a large market order to an exchange, it is likely to walk the book
and the average execution price won’t be the NBBO. But if we send it to
the dark pool, we may just need to wait for a short time before our order is
completely filled, and there is a chance that the NBBO midprice won’t move
adversely against us over that short period. The third and most important
reason for sending our order to the dark pool is that, as we shall see below,
market orders carry information, and this information is captured by the
‘‘order flow’’ measure that we will discuss in the section on ‘‘Order Flow.’’
If we plan to send more orders on the same side, this order flow information
will cause other traders to front-run our subsequent orders. If our order
is executed in a dark pool, no order flow is generated because there is no
‘‘aggressor’’ side to the trade.
However, there are reasons to avoid dark pools, too. The most prob-
lematic is that the NBBO midprice can be front-run or manipulated so that
executions in the dark pool are disadvantaged.
Front-running the NBBO midprice is a form of latency arbitrage. Recall
that NBBO is determined by the slow SIP market feed. Hence, a trader

subscribing to fast direct feeds from the exchanges knows where the NBBO
midprice will be in the next millisecond or two. If that midprice will go
higher, the trader just needs to send a buy order to the dark pool now
and then send a sell order later once the new official NBBO is established.
It is true that many dark pools no longer use the official NBBO midprice
as their matching price. Instead, they also subscribe to the direct feeds
of various exchanges to determine the actual NBBO. However, they are
apparently still somemicroseconds behind some high-frequency traders.
This is the reason why the former dark pool IEX was established to much
fanfare (Lewis, 2014). It has introduced a 350-microsecond delay between
order submission and execution, so that it has the time to update to the
latest actual NBBO before allowing an order to match at that midprice
(Aisen, 2015).
Manipulating the midprice is an altogether more nefarious activity.
A trader S sends a small buy limit order to an exchange to increase the NBB,
and thus, the midprice. S then sends a large sell order to the dark pool for
execution at this raised midprice. S next cancels the buy limit order at the
exchange, and sends a small sell limit order to that exchange to decrease
the NBO. S sends a buy order to the dark pool to cover its short position.
Finally, S cancels its sell limit order at the exchange. Note that even if the
small limit orders that S placed on the exchanges were filled before S got
the chance to cancel them, no big harm was done, since they were small,
and in that case S does not need to follow up with the large order to the
dark pool. We call this trader ‘‘S’’ because this is consideredspoofing,an
illegal activity. But just because it is illegal doesn’t mean it is not happening,
and that other dark pool users won’t be disadvantaged by it.
The two ways to game the dark pool midprice described are all done
by third-party traders, through little or no fault of the dark pool itself.
But some dark pools are actually complicit in taking advantage of the
slower traders. They would, for example, reveal information on resting
orders to their affiliated proprietary trading group (e.g., Pipeline, ITG;
see Hasbrouck, 2015), or they would let high-frequency trading partners
get access to such information (e.g., Barclays, Hasbrouck, 2015.) Such
dark pools are only dark to the general public—they are brightly lit for
insiders and partners! Some dark pools also allow their partners to submit a
special order type which price-improves the NBBO midprice by less than a
penny (e.g., UBS, Hasbrouck, 2015.) These partners who submit subpenny
orders are likely to get filled first when they detect that the order flow is
not informed (and where the order flow information comes from inside

information on the dark pool order book). Naturally, all these gaming
and information leaks introduce a high degree of market impact and adverse
selection to large orders sent to these dark pools.
So in conclusion, is it recommended to route market orders to dark pools?
The short answer is: You can always route them to dark pools that do not have
such problems, which formerly would include IEX. Beyond IEX, you can
quantitatively measure the degree of adverse selection (as will be discussed
in the next section) for the dark pools that you are considering routing to,
and route orders to dark pools with lowest adverse selection first (Saraiya
and Mittal, 2009).
## 10
You can also add the IOC modifier to your order, so
that it won’t be subject to adverse selection. This means that if there is not
enough liquidity resting on the opposite side of the order book on the dark
pool, the unexecuted part of your order will be cancelled. Finally, if your
order isn’t that large, my personal experience is that routing to any dark
pool often beats sending a market order and letting your broker route it to
the NBBO.
■Adverse Selection Reduction
Sometimes we have a buy limit order on the book, but we never manage to
get it filled because no one hits our bid. A little later, the best bid goes above
ours, making our purchase further out of reach. We incur opportunity cost.
Other times, our buy limit order does get filled quickly, but right after our
purchase, the BBO goes lower, generating (unrealized) loss for us. If these
two situations happen often, then we are suffering from adverse selection in
that market.
Adverse selection happens when prices on average go down after
we buy something, and go up when we sell something. This happens
because the traders on the other side of our trade (the ‘‘aggressors’’) are
informedones—they possess information or models that are good at short-
term prediction of prices.
Who, then, would be theuninformedtraders? There is a saying: ‘‘If you
can’t spot the sucker at the poker table, it’s probably you.’’ If we are running
a rebate-earning or market-making strategy, we would be the uninformed
traders, since our only model is to buy when prices are cheap, no matter
why they are cheap. If we are running a large mutual fund, and suffer
some redemption requests from our retail customers, we may need to sell
some holdings to raise cash. In that case, we would also be the uninformed

traders—we are selling because of our immediate liquidity need, not
because we know where the prices will go. (See the section on ‘‘Mutual
Funds Asset Fire Sale and Forced Purchases’’ in Chan, 2013, and also Harris,
2003, for a general discussion of informed versus liquidity traders.) Adverse
selection can be measured quite accurately by computing the difference
between the P&L of unfilled orders and the P&L of filled orders over a short
time frame from 1 second to 30 minutes (Saraiya and Mittal, 2009). As we
will discuss in the section on ‘‘Order Flow,’’ market orders generate order
flow, and market orders from highly informed traders generate ‘‘toxic’’
order flow (Easley, Lopez de Prado, and O’Hara, 2012). It is toxic to
market makers and mean-reversion traders because of adverse selection.
Adverse selection only affects orders that are resting on the order book—
in other words, it only affects the passive orders that provide liquidity. Such
passive orders include limit orders and market orders sent to dark pools that
are not immediately executable. If we are the informed traders, we would
be sending market orders to the lit exchanges so that our information does
not get stale, and of course such market orders always get filled immedi-
ately. Whether the trade turns out to be profitable or not, it is not the fault
of the counterparty—it is the fault of our own price prediction model. The
counterparty is not selectively filling our unprofitable market orders. Send-
ing limit IOC orders to the lit exchanges, or market IOC orders to the dark
pools will also protect us from adverse selection. Either way, the order will
not rest on the order book and cannot be adversely selected against. Limit
and market IOC orders take, not make, liquidity.
As we mentioned in the section on ‘‘Latency Reduction’’ and that on
‘‘Adding Liquidity,’’ if our strategy does involve providing liquidity, then we
should at least make sure that our orders are at the head of the queue in exe-
cution priority. This way, we will hopefully benefit from exchange rebates or
other forms of market-making profits more often in order to offset the losses
inflicted by toxic flow. Lower-order submission and confirmation latency,
and using special order types such as hide-and-light and ISO, also help.
Most of what we have discussed applies generally to US stock and futures
markets. (Some of them may apply to the US stock options markets, too.)
It also applies to currency markets, with one notable exception.
Currency markets are even more fragmented than the US stock mar-
ket. There is no consolidated order book, no routing, and no Reg NMS to
encourage best executions. Anybody (at least anybody outside of CFTC and
other national regulators’ jurisdiction) can start an FX brokerage and run
their own currency market. Liquidity (i.e., orders that sit on the book) is

often provided not by other buy-side traders, but by large banks or hedge
funds, and all manner of mark-ups can be applied as the brokerage see fit.
In other words, the spot currency market is an over-the-counter market,
not an exchange-based market. Despite all this opaqueness, the spot cur-
rency market is still the most liquid market, and often has narrower bid-ask
spreads in percentage terms than even currency futures which are traded on
exchanges.
There is one feature in the spot currency market, however, that is
particularly troublesome to traders. This is the ‘‘last look’’ feature.Last
lookmeans that some of the quotes we see on the order book are not
firm: Market makers (often called ‘‘LP’’ for liquidity provider, or liquidity
partner, in the industry) can simply not honor the quotes after they have
received our marketable orders. They have many milliseconds to check
whether the quotes they pose on different market centers are all being hit in
the same direction simultaneously, and decide what, if any, fraction of these
quotes to honor. This may sound reasonable: Because the currency market
is not consolidated, not even virtually as for the US stock market, the LP
has no choice but to post quotes on many different market centers. But if
all these quotes were filled, the LP will end up with a large unbalanced
position, and such positions pose significant risks.
In addition to avoiding getting hit on multiple markets simultaneously,
LPs can also use the last look period to check if the BBO changes significantly
across all these markets. If so, this would indicate a large informed trader
is on the other side of the trade, and they would decline to fill this order to
avoid adverse selection. Unfortunately, this act of avoiding adverse selection
on the part of the LPinducesadverse selection for the buy-side traders.
If market makers can pick and choose when to fill our market orders or
marketable limit IOC orders, then there is no doubt that our orders will
suffer from adverse selection.
I was a victim of last look on one occasion. Our team backtested a fairly
high-frequency strategy based on order flow (similar to the one discussed in
the section on ‘‘Order Flow’’). It was very profitable not only in backtest,
but also in live walk-forward test using HotspotFX’s UAT (user accep-
tance testing) account. This account uses real-time quotes from the real
HotspotFX order book for simulation. However, when we started trading in
a production account, our strategy was devastated. Why? Our market orders
that got filled were unprofitable, and the ones that got rejected due to last
look were the ones that turned out to be profitable—a classic symptom of
adverse selection. It is true that we can request last look to be turned off for

Trim Size: 6in x 9inChan  c06.tex  V2 - 12/11/2016  12:44 A.M.  Page 177

## 
the quotes presented to us. But once we did that, the BBO spread widened
considerably, and the strategy was still unprofitable despite the absence of
last look.
It is important to note that last look induces adverse selection on market
or limit IOC orders, but has no effect on limit orders that we place on the
order book. This is quite in contrast to adverse selection in the stock or
futures markets, which affects limit orders on the book but not market or
limit IOC orders. Hence, last look only adversely affects FX momentum
strategies, but not mean-reverting or market-making strategies.
As my experience above shows, the presence of last look also presents
a problem for backtesting or even walk-forward-testing FX momentum
strategies: One can never be sure which one of our orders will actually get
filled. So accuracy of such backtests or forward tests is questionable.
Fortunately, not every FX market center has the last look feature (e.g.,
LMAX does not have last look), and even for those market centers that do
have this feature (e.g., HotspotFX and FXall), there is an effort underway
to tighten constraints on its use (Albanese, 2015). They may shorten the
period where last look can take place, and they can set minimum acceptance
rates for liquidity partners (i.e., they cannot reject too many orders based
on last look).
■Backtesting Intraday Strategies
To properly backtest intraday strategies that use market orders, we have to at
least use NBBO (or BBO, in the case of instruments such as futures that trade
on a single market center) data sampled at whatever frequency is appropriate
to our strategies. This is because liquidity can vary greatly intraday,
## 11
and so
can execution cost. It is quite inaccurate to backtest an intraday strategy by
assuming half an average bid-ask spread as execution cost.
When backtesting US stocks strategies, even such top-of-book data are
not sufficient for reasons that we have touched on before: thin NBBO liq-
uidity means that our order size can easily be bigger than the NBBO size, so
it will have to walk the book at the local exchange, or parts of it will have
to be rerouted to another exchange. This means a true backtest requires
at least level 2 quotes. But even level 2 quotes won’t be able to accurately
reflect the actual route that our order, or pieces of it, will take across the 60+
market centers, and what prices it will execute against during its excellent
adventure.

(Why does even a stock like AAPL have a typical NBBO size of 189 shares,
as mentioned in the introduction? Those may be ‘‘sniffer’’ orders placed by
high-frequency traders to gauge market demand, or to gauge the quantity
of hidden orders inside the NBBO, or to earn liquidity rebates by always
standing at the head-of-queue using hide-and-light orders or ISOs. In any
case, due to the fear of adverse selection by large informed traders, nobody
wants to post a large order at the NBBO. In fact, these small orders may
be a way to detect the toxic flow that induces adverse selection, so that the
high-frequency traders can trade in the same direction!)
Even more difficult is to backtest a mean-reverting or market-making
strategy that uses limit orders. A static snapshot of the order book(s) will
not tell us whether our limit order will be filled, because we don’t know
what priority we have in the queue. One has to use the stream of historical
order book messages such as the aforementioned Nasdaq ITCH data
## 12
that
allows us to reconstruct the history of the order book. HotspotFX also pro-
vides an ITCH feed for its currency market. These messages include events
such as a limit order addition (only for displayed orders), execution
## 13
(in full
or in part, for displayed or hidden orders), cancellation, and the associated
ticker, price, size, side, the unique market participant ID, the unique order
ID (only for displayed orders), and, of course, the time stamp in millisecond
or higher frequencies.
## 14
Incoming market orders are not recorded by these
messages, but their interactions with the order book can be inferred from
the executions of the limit orders. These ITCH messages are available to
subscribers during live trading. But missing from them are the modifiers, so
we still won’t know if an order will get ahead of us in queue priority because
it is a hide-and-light order, or an ISO. Naturally, backtesting a strategy using
these messages is not a simple task, but there are platforms such as Lime
Brokerage’s Strategy Studio that incorporate a fill simulator for limit orders,
and many high-frequency trading firms as well as brokers have built advanced
simulators for their internal or customers’ use.
## 15
(Sometimes an exchange
or a data vendor will only provide us with historical ITCH messages but not
the BBO quotes for our backtest. In this case, we will have to construct the
BBO ourselves using these messages. Example 6.2 shows you how.)
Example 6.2: Constructing the BBO using ITCH messages
This coding example shows how one can find out the BBO of an order
book at every instant by processing a time series of messages similar
to the ITCH messages from Nasdaq or HotspotFX. However, I do

not have samples of Nasdaq or HotspotFX ITCH messages—I only
have samples of bitcoin (see Chapter 7) messages from the Coinsetter
exchange. But the algorithm for constructing the order book is, of
course, the same no matter what the actual traded instrument is.
The Coinsetter messages have five important fields that describe
an event: ExchangeTime (in nanoseconds based on UTC time),
Side (BUY or SELL), Level (i.e., order price), EventAmount (i.e.,
order size), InformationType (one of ‘‘WORKING_CONFIRMED,’’
which means order addition, ‘‘CANCELED_CONFIRMED,’’ ‘‘FILL_
CONFIRMED,’’ ‘‘PARTIAL_FILL_CONFIRMED’’). One way to
simulate an order book is to use the binary search tree data structure,
implemented in MATLAB as part of a free Data Structures package
by Brian Moore (www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/
45123-data-structures). One binary search tree will keep us updated
as to which bid (active, not filled, or cancelled) has the highest price
(best bid), and another tree will similarly handle the offers, amidst all
the additions, cancellations, fills, and partial fills events. So actually,
the order book is split into two independent halves: thebuyOrderBook
and thesellOrderBook.
To initialize the binary search trees, a.k.a. order book, we add the
first orders:
assert(strcmp(action(1), 'WORKING_CONFIRMED'));
if (strcmp(side(1), 'BUY'))
bid(1)=price(1);
bidSize(1)=orderSize(1);
buyOrderBook.Insert(price(1), bidSize(1));
elseif (strcmp(side(1), 'SELL'))
ask(1)=price(1);
askSize(1)=orderSize(1);
sellOrderBook.Insert(price(1), askSize(1));
end
The bid(1) (ask(1)) represents the best bid (offer) at the time of the
first event. Note that the arrays bid and ask are indexed by events, not
by regular time intervals. These are truly ‘‘tick’’ data.
Then we need to process the subsequent events sequentially in a
for-loop, assuming they appear in chronological order. For example,
if we add a buy order, we need to find out if its price is better than the
current best bid. If so, we reset the best bid, and its size, and insert that
bid into the buyOrderBook. If its price is the same as the current best

## 
bid, we merely increase the best bid size, and update the bid size in the
buyOrderBook (a delete followed by an insert). If its price is inferior to
the current best bid, then we will just insert it into the buyOrderBook,
and copy forward the current best bid. The following code fragment
illustrates this:
if (strcmp(action(t), 'WORKING_CONFIRMED'))
if (strcmp(side(t), 'BUY'))
if (price(t) > bid(t-1) || isnan(bid(t-1)))
bid(t)=price(t);
bidSize(t)=orderSize(t);
buyOrderBook.Insert(price(t), bidSize(t));
elseif (price(t) == bid(t-1))
bid(t)=bid(t-1);
bidSize(t)=bidSize(t-1)+orderSize(t);
buyOrderBook.Delete(buyOrderBook.Search(price(t)));
buyOrderBook.Insert(price(t), bidSize(t));
else
bid(t)=bid(t-1);
bidSize(t)=bidSize(t-1);
buyOrderBook.Insert(price(t), orderSize(t));
end
ask(t)=ask(t-1);
askSize(t)=askSize(t-1);
end
end
If there is a buy order cancellation or a fill (full or partial), we need
to see if that order is the best bid. If so, we need to find out what
the next best bid is from the buyOrderBook and update the best bid.
Otherwise, we just copy forward the current best bid, and delete that
order from the order book or update its size.

'FILL_CONFIRMED') || strcmp(action(t), 'PARTIAL_FILL_

end
Naturally, a symmetrical process occurs for sell orders events. The
complete code can be downloaded as buildOrderBook.m.
For those of us who may not have the time to build such sophisticated
backtesting platforms for ourselves or the resources to rent them, we can
at least backtest strategies that can be executed with market orders and still
remain profitable. (See Chapter 1 for commercially available backtesting

platforms.) We will demonstrate in Example 6.3 how we can backtest
an intraday futures strategy using MATLAB with BBO data sampled at
25 ms. But the essential difference between backtesting using BBO bar
data (whether it is daily, minute, 25 ms, or 1 ms bars) andtickdata is
that bar data have prices for every bar while tick data, even if they are
sampled at regular intervals, may show prices at irregular intervals in the
historical file. If the instruments’ quote price changes more frequently
than the frequency of the time stamps, we may also find multiple ticks to
have the same time stamp. One can, of course, create bars from tick data,
but if quotes change infrequently, we would be utilizing both CPU and
memory very inefficiently when backtesting. Hence, backtesting algorithms
(such as that in Example 6.3) that are designed specifically to handle prices
with irregular time stamps are needed.
Where can we find intraday data that are suitable for backtesting intraday
strategies? We already mentioned the ITCH data, but that captures only
stock tick data from Nasdaq and is quite expensive to obtain unless you are
an academic researcher. NYSE will also sell you the consolidated trades and
quotes (TAQ) data
## 16
reported to the SIP. There are also many third-party
vendors that will sell you high frequency data for stocks, futures, and
options. However, not all high frequency data are of equal quality. For
example, CQG Data Factory’s TAQ data are time-stamped only at one
minute, and we have no idea whether the ticks in a block of quotes with the
same time stamp are in chronological order. Furthermore, I have verified
that they miss a number of trade ticks in their ES futures data files. Similarly,
Algoseek’s 1-millisecond TAQ data available forrentthrough QuantGo.com
misses many end-of-day auction prices even for AAPL. (They are also
missing data on some days for some important futures contracts such as CL,
even for front months.) Importantly, one may need such high-frequency data
even if one wants to backtest interday strategies accurately, and such missing
ticks cause inaccuracies for such interday backtests as well (see Box 6.2).
Box 6.2: Beware of Low Frequency Data
(Part of this section is taken from a talk I gave at QuantCon 2015 and
published on my blog as epchan.blogspot.com/2015/04/beware-of-
low-frequency-data.html.)
One may think that the TAQ tick data I mentioned in this chapter is
important only for backtesting intraday strategies. But even when we

are backtesting stock strategies that only trade at the market open or
close, the usual consolidated daily historical data that most data ven-
dors (e.g., csidata.com, Quandl.com) provide will induce substantial
noise, and may dangerously inflate backtest performance, especially for
mean-reverting strategies.
Consolidated daily data come from the trades recorded on the SIP
feed. Since the SIP feed captures trades from more than 60 stock
market centers in the United States, the ‘‘opening’’ or the ‘‘closing’’
trade can come from any of these places quite by chance. (For
example, the open price may come from whichever market center
happens to have the first trade at or just after 9:30 a.m. ET, and the
close price may come from whichever market center that has the last
trade at or just before 4:00 p.m. ET.) These trades may be the result
of an execution of a mere hundred shares, and their prices can be
quite different from the prices based on the open or close auctions
at the primary exchange for these stocks. A primary exchange of a
stock is the exchange where the stock is listed. For example, AAPL is
listed on the Nasdaq, and IBM is listed on the NYSE. What’s special
about the primary exchange of a stock is that whenever we send a
Market-on-Open (MOO), Limit-on-Open (LOO), Market-on-Close
(MOC), or Limit-on-Close (LOC) order to our broker, it will be
routed to the primary exchange to participate in the auction there.
Every exchange runs an auction on every stock, but only the auction at
the primary exchange of a stock has significant volume due to all these
routings. So the price we will get for our MOO/LOO/MOC/LOC
orders is the primary exchange auction price, not the consolidated
open or close price that we see from the typical data vendor. The
consolidated open or close prices are not the most accurate for
backtesting purposes.
How big are their differences? On April 27, 2010, for example,
AAPL’s primary exchange auction closing price is $262.26, while the
consolidated closing price is $262.04, an 8 bps difference. This may
seem small, but remember that this difference is essentially uncorre-
lated white noise—its sign fluctuates from day to day randomly. Hence,
if we invent a mean-reverting strategy that buys whenever the consol-
idated close is lower than the primary exchange close, and short when
it is the opposite, then we will be picking up these 8 bps differences
regularly, generating a significant but fictitious excess return in back-
test. This excess return is fictitious because we can’t really guarantee
execution at the consolidated price.

Where can we find the historical primary exchange open/close
prices? Bloomberg provides that, but is expensive. Here is where the
TAQ data come in handy. We can rent such tick data quite cheaply
(certainly cheaper than a Bloomberg subscription) from Algoseek
through QuantGo.com. These TAQ data time-stamped at 1 ms come
with a special flag (‘‘Cross’’) that indicates a trade participated in the
opening/closing auction, and if we select only those Cross trades that
took place on the primary exchange, we will theoretically know the
primary exchange open/close prices for our backtest. However, as
mentioned in the main text, Algoseek sometimes misses many ticks
in their data. For example, on October 28, 2014, they are missing all
the AAPL trades that occurred on Nasdaq at the close, and thus we
can’t figure out what the primary exchange close price was!
Another data provider, Nanex, provides only the top 10 layers of the
order book (which isn’t too much of a problem), and with only 25 ms time
stamps, which isn’t a problem here because the ticks are in chronological
order as they are stored in a tape format. But the main problem is that
because their data are stored in a tape format, it takes quite a bit of program-
ming to extract them. Tickdata.com (now part of onemarketdata.com) sells
only BBO quotes (and trades), so we can’t really backtest orders larger than
the BBO quote size (though they do have 1 ms time stamps). Kibot.com
also sell tick data at a reasonable price, but they do not report quote sizes,
nor do they provide the aggressor tags for futures trades. As we shall see
in the section on ‘‘Order Flow,’’ such tags are very handy for determin-
ing order flow. (When backtesting futures strategies you may find that some
quotes are marked ‘‘implied’’. These are legitimate quotes that can be traded
on. See Box 6.3 for a detailed explanation.)
Box 6.3: Calendar spread quotes data
When backtesting futures strategies using BBO data, one often
see quotes that are marked ‘‘implied.’’ These are quotes are that are
‘‘implied-out’’ by limit orders on calendar spreads, and they can be
executed against any market orders. To understand how a calendar
spread limit order can imply a quote on the outright contract, we use
an example taken from Aikin (2012).
Let’s say we have the following state (Table 6.3) of the BBO for the
outright market for the Eurodollar futures ED, for the contract months
March 2002 (H2) and June 2002 (M2). The numbers in parentheses
are the quote sizes (number of contracts).

0.22. The sizes of the implied-in quotes are 100 by 100. Now, suppose
a trader places a limit order to buy 50 contracts of H2M2 at 0.23,
which is the midprice between the H2M2 BBO shown in Table 6.3.
This will update the outright BBO, as shown in Table 6.4.
## TABLE 6.4
BBO for Outright Market after Adding New Calendar

## Offer98.79 (100)98.56 (150)0.24 (100)
## Bid98.78 (150)98.55 (100)0.23 (50)
Note that the implied-out BBO prices have not changed, but the
sizes (inbold) have (Aikin, 2015). If there is an incoming market
order to sell 50 contracts of H2, the buy calendar spread order will
be filled—it has higher priority in the queue than outrights. This
outright market order will let the original calendar spread order
buy 50 H2 contracts at 98.78, and it will trigger an execution of
the outright buy limit order for M2 at 98.55 so that the calendar
spread order can sell 50 contracts. Similarly, if there is an incoming
market order to buy 50 contracts of M2, the buy calendar spread
order will also be filled. This implied-in and implied-out pricing
is highly advantageous for both market taker and maker, since it
improves the quote size for the market taker, and it allows the
market maker’s calendar spread order to get filled with a market
order on just one leg. So if you are backtesting futures strategies,
make sure the data vendor has included implied-out quotes. For
further information, see Aikin (2012) or www.cmegroup.com/

■Order Flow
Order flow issignedtransaction volume: If a transaction of sizesis the
result of a buy market order,
## 17
the order flow is+s; if it is the result of a
sell market order, the order flow is−s. Order flow is typically aggregated
over a period of time and over many transactions in that period to create
a more robust measure. Researchers have long known that order flow is
positively correlated with future price change (see Lyons, 2001, or Cartea,
Jaimungal, and Penalva, 2015). This makes intuitive sense: On average,
traders using market orders are more likely to possess superior information
since they are apparently so sure of the future price change that they are
willing to pay the bid-ask spread to get into position quickly. In contrast,
market makers do not usually know which way the market will move, and
they are content to place a limit order passively on the order book, hoping
to profit from the bid-ask spread. If we can determine the order flow at the
moment, we can join the bandwagon of the aggressive, informed traders
and enter trades in the same direction as well.
The only hitch in this beautiful strategy is that most data feeds don’t tell
you whether a trade is due to a buy or sell market order. Only data feeds
such as the Nasdaq or HotspotFX’s ITCH feeds contain all the limit order
messages (as discussed in the previous section) necessary to compute order
flow. (In the case of HotspotFX, order flow lags by a second or so.) These
low-latency direct feeds enable us to determine whether the disappearance
of a buy (sell) limit order was due to cancellation or execution. If it was
an execution, we can infer that it was hit with a sell (buy) market order,
which contributed to the negative (positive) order flow. Another example of
a direct data feed from an exchange that contains such detailed information
is CME’s MDP Market Data, which contains a tag for each trade that is called
the ‘‘aggressor’’ tag. For example, Tag 5797-AggressorSide indicates a buy
when its value is 1, and a sell when its value is 2 (CME, 2015). As we shall see
in Chapter 7, some bitcoin exchanges also provide either the ITCH messages
or aggressor flags.
For those of us who do not have subscriptions to such potentially pricey
direct feeds, researchers have developed methods to estimate order flow
using only price and volume. There is thetick rule,where a trade that
transacts at a price higher than the previous trade generates a ‘‘buy’’
(positive order flow), and vice versa for a ‘‘sell’’ (if the trade price is the
same as the previous one, the order flow is assigned the same sign as that of
the previous trade). There is thequote rule,where a trade that transacts at
a price higher than the midprice is considered a buy, and vice versa for a

sell (it generates zero order flow if the trade occurs at the midprice). There
is also the Lee-Ready algorithm that uses the quote rule for trades away
from midprice, and the tick rule for trades at the midprice. More recently,
there is a technique calledbulk volume classification(Easley, Lopez de Prado,
and O’Hara, 2015) that demonstrates how one can use price change and
volume per bar instead of per trade to determine order flow. (See Box 6.4
for an explanation.) Using bulk volume classification (BVC) obviates the
need for a tick data feed, and is therefore much less data intensive to either
backtest or live-trade a strategy that uses order flow.
All these methods involve a certain amount of guess work and statistics,
and are therefore not as accurate as having direct data feeds. Applying the tick
rule or Lee-Ready algorithm to the US stock markets is especially inaccu-
rate because of the presence of nondisplayed orders both on exchanges and
darkpools,whichtogetheraccountformorethanone-thirdofallexecutions.
As you may recall, most dark pool executions happen at midprices and gen-
erate no order flow. For executions on lit exchanges against hidden orders,
we would not know whether the hidden orders were buy or sell orders, so
order flow cannot be computed, either. The CME is a bit more transpar-
ent in this regard: An order must display at least part of its total quantity
(the so-calledicebergorder). Despite such inaccuracies, we will demonstrate
atradingstrategyinExample6.3basedonestimatedorderflowontheE-mini
S&P500indexfuturesonCMEGlobex.Wewillcomparetheperformanceof
the strategy using order flow computed exactly from the exchange-provided
aggressor tags and order flow estimated using BVC with volume bars.
Box 6.4: Determining order flow using bulk volume
classification (BVC)
Bulk volume classification is a method of estimating order flow
using only bar data with volume and trade prices, instead of tick
data for every trade. This makes order flow computation much less
computationally intensive, with the added advantage that executions
due to hidden orders will be included in the calculation.
The bar data used in BVC can be the usual fixed-time bars, or
fixed-volume bars. Volume bars have variable time durations, but
each has the same volume (number of shares or contracts executed).
Log returns on volume bars are found to have a more Gaussian
distribution, and as the BVC formula assumes Gaussian distribution of
log returns, volume bars instead of time bars are the preferred input.

The trading strategy is in principle very simple. If we are using aggressor
tags for order flow, then we can compute exactly the order flow due to
every trade tick within the past minute. If we are using the BVC method,
then we will use a fixed number of past volume bars to compute the order
flow in that period. This means we will only trade when a volume bar
completes, unlike the aggressor tag method, where we may trade whenever
a new trade tick arrives. Either way, if this order flow is greater (smaller)
than some threshold, we send out a buy (sell) market order. We will exit
the resulting position, again using market orders, whenever the order flow
is zero or has the opposite sign from the one triggering the entry. Naturally,
both the entry threshold and the implicit exit threshold of zero, as well
as the lookback period of one minute, should be optimized in-sample and
tested out-of-sample.
Example 6.3: Order flow strategy
We use two different methods, aggressor tag and BVC, to compute
order flow, and compare how well a trading strategy based on each
fares.
The instrument we trade is the front contract of the E-mini S&P 500
futures (symbol: ES) on the CME Globex. Each point move in this
contract is worth $50, with the minimum tick equal to 0.25 points
($12.50). It is traded from Sunday to Friday around the clock from
6 p.m. to 4:15 p.m. ET on the next day, and from 4:30 p.m. to 5 p.m.
ET. In this example, we will just pick one day (October 1, 2012) of
data for the contract ES.Z12 to illustrate the method.
For the aggressor tag method, data are from Algoseek, provided
through QuantGo.com’s platform,
## 18
anditistime-stampedat1ms.It
consists of BBO quotes, as well as trades. The quote sizes are typically
in the hundreds during the ‘‘regular’’ trading hours of 9:30 a.m. to
4:15 p.m. ET. The trade sizes, however, are typically far smaller—in
the double or even single digits. Some days, the average trade size is
under three contracts (Hunsader, 2015). There can, however, be many
quote updates and trades within 1 ms. (One-third of ES’s volume is due
to high-frequency trading. See Clark-Joseph, 2013.) With the aggres-
sor tag method, it is important to determine the BBO whenever a trade
occurs. We have preprocessed the data and align the BBO and trades
to appear in MATLAB arrays with the same number of rows. Schemat-
ically, they can be represented in tabular form, as shown in Table 6.5.

The first column is the MATLAB serial date number of a tick, where
the integer part represents the number of days since some arbitrary
reference time.
Now that the data are properly aligned, we can use the aggressor tag
to determine the order flow for each trade tick:
ordflow=zeros(size(price));
ordflow(strcmp(event, 'T') & strcmp(aggressor, 'B'))= quantity
(strcmp(event, 'T') & strcmp(aggressor, 'B'));
ordflow(strcmp(event, 'T') & strcmp(aggressor, 'S'))=-quantity
(strcmp(event, 'T') & strcmp(aggressor, 'S'));
As in all backtests using tick data, we need a for-loop that advances
one trade at a time in this program in order to find out exactly which
ticks are within one minute of the current trade tick. To do this, it is
easiest to compute the cumulative sum of the order flow since the first
tick, and then take the difference between the value one minute ago
and now:
lookback=60; % 1 min
cumOrdflow=cumsum(ordflow);
for t=1:length(cumOrdflow)
idx=find( dn <= dn(t)-lookback/60/60/24);
if (∼isempty(idx))
ordflow_lookback=cumOrdflow(t)-cumOrdflow(idx(end));
end
end
Now we are ready to apply the trading rule: buy if aggregate order
flow is greater than a threshold, exit a long position if it is not positive,

and vice versa for shorts. We also need to update the existing position
(denotedpos), update the latest entry price (entryP) for P&L computa-
tion, and the daily P&L (dailyPL) itself. If the aggregate order flow is
not positive enough to trigger a buy, and not negative enough to trigger
a sell, we just need to update the daily P&L based on the midprice.
if (ordflow_lookback > entryThreshold)
if ( pos <= 0)
if (pos < 0)
dailyPL=dailyPL+(entryP-ask(t)); % Aggressive
entryP=ask(t); % Aggressive
else
entryP=ask(t); % Aggressive
end
pos=1;
end
elseif (ordflow_lookback < -entryThreshold)
if (pos >= 0)
if (pos > 0)
dailyPL=dailyPL+(bid(t)-entryP);
entryP=bid(t);
else
entryP=bid(t);
end
pos=-1;
end
else
if (ordflow_lookback <= exitThreshold && pos > 0)
dailyPL=dailyPL+(bid(t)-entryP);
pos=0;
elseif (ordflow_lookback >= -exitThreshold && pos < 0)
dailyPL=dailyPL+(entryP-ask(t));
pos=0;
end
end
If we choose theentryThresholdto be 66 (which is roughly the 95
th
percentile of order flow for that day), we find that the daily P&L is
$300 ($4 per trade). This assumes we are using market orders that
cross the bid-ask spread. If we assume midprice executions instead,

the daily P&L is $762.50 ($10.17 per trade). But this is an unrealistic
assumption. We have not included the minimum exchange and clear-
ing fee of $0.095 per contract. (If you are not a high frequency trader
generating tremendous volume, this total fee is more typically $0.16
per contract. Interactive Brokers charges $2.47 per contract.) The
complete code can be downloaded as aggressorTag_algoseek.m.
Note one defect in our aggressor tag trading algorithm: We make
a trading decision only when we encounter a trade tick. What if the
aggregate order flow in the past minute needs an update because some
old trades fall out this lookback, but there is no new trade? In a proper
backtest (just as in live trading), we need to update the order flow at
the same frequency as our data, which is 1 ms.
For our volume bar tests, we use data from Nanex.net that are
time-stamped at 25 ms. To generate the volume bars suitable for the
BVC method, we first aggregate those trade ticks in Table 6.5 so that
we have 500 contracts per bar. This number means that each volume
bar will typically span a few 25 ms bars. (It is OK to have fewer than
500 contracts so that each 25 ms bar will span a few volume bars, but
we then must be careful in aligning with the BBO quotes, which will
all have the same time stamps but may, in fact, be ahead or behind
the end of a volume bar. To ensure proper alignment, we would need
to assume that the trades and quotes are sorted chronologically in the
ticker stream.) After aligning with the BBO quotes, a few sample vol-
ume bars are shown in Table 6.6.

To determine the order flow, we need to compute the change in
priceΔPin equation 6.1, denoted deltaPrice in the code below:
prevTradePrice=backshift(1, fillMissingData(lastPrice));
deltaPrice=lastPrice-prevTradePrice;

Then we use a 100 volume-bar lookback to determine the Gaussian
CDF function Z. This lookback is a parameter that can be optimized
in-sample. (Instead of normalizingΔPby휎
## ΔP
as in equation 6.1, we
can enter standard deviation as an additional parameter in the MATLAB
cdf function.)
lookback=100; % Num bars used for stddev of volume-weighted

buyVol=NaN(size(lastPrice)); % Buy volume as fraction of

myDeltaPrice=deltaPrice(t-lookback:t-1);
myDeltaPrice(∼isfinite(myDeltaPrice))=[];
buyVol(t)=cdf('Normal', deltaPrice(t), 0, std(myDeltaPrice));
end
We have computedbuyVol(t)as the fraction of order flow due to buy
orders. The fraction for sell orders is just 1−buyVol(t). Our trading
rule is to buy whenever the fraction for buys is greater than 0.95, and
we will exit a long position if the fraction falls below 0.5. The exact
opposite holds for sells. Otherwise, the code is very similar to the one
for the aggressor tag method:
entryThreshold=0.95;
exitThreshold =0.5;

if (buyVol(t) > entryThreshold)

end
The daily P&L using BVC is−$3,975 (−$5.8 per trade), which
is much worse than the aggressor tag strategy on a per trade basis.
If we assume the unrealistic midprice executions, the daily P&L is $400
($0.58 per trade), again worse than the aggressor tag strategy. The
complete code can be downloaded as volumeBar.m.
Note a defect in our BVC trading algorithm (similar to the one for
using the aggressor tag): We make a trading decision only when a vol-
ume bar ends. We should actually compute the past volume bars every
25 ms, and use those to make trading decisions.
The problem with the aggressor tag-based strategy is that even when
there is no trade tick, we are still supposed to update our aggregated order
flow calculation, because some older trades would have rolled out of our
one-minute lookback window. Unfortunately, this update would make the
code quite a bit more complicated as we have to record the ‘‘expiration
time’’ of each trade and insert into our chronological trade sequence these
expiration events. We omit this detail in Example 6.3. There is a similar
problem with the BVC version of the strategy: we can only trade at the end
of a volume bar, which creates unnecessary delays. In theory, if our tick data

## 
has 1 ms time stamps, we need to check for the one-minute order flow every
1 ms, even if this means creating a whole new series of volume bars. This of
course is very computationally demanding.
Our example applied this strategy to only one day of ES data for illus-
tration purpose. But even with this limited amount of data, some pertinent
issues emerge. The strategy is not very profitable if we assume our orders
have to cross the bid-ask spread to be filled, and highly profitable if we assume
they can be filled at midprice. Since the strategy is trend-following (with the
trend set by the sign of the order flow), there is an urgency in getting our
orders filled, and therefore we must use market orders. So the not very prof-
itable scenario is probably more realistic. However, hypothetically profitable
executions at midprice tell us that changes in midprices do go in the same
direction as past order flow, so the premise of the strategy is sound.
Comparing the returns of the strategy using aggressor tag vs. using BVC
volume bars, we see that the BVC method generates much worse results.
This is consistent with some research indicating that order flow based on
this method may not be very accurate (Andersen, 2013).
Are there ways to improve on the profitability of this order flow strat-
egy? Naturally, we should eliminate delays for trades due to the absence of
triggering ticks for the aggressor tag method or due to predefined finite
volume bars for the BVC method. But more interestingly, we may notice
that the sensitivity (regression coefficient) of the price change in response
to past order flow may not be constant. We can choose to send a mar-
ket order only when we believe that the price change as a function of both
order flow and sensitivity is large. This sensitivity may depend on the state
of the order book (less liquidity probably means higher sensitivity), and
some high frequency traders may actually be probing this sensitivity con-
tinuously using small orders (Clark-Joseph, 2013). Alternatively, we can
use linear regression over some moving lookback period or the Kalman
filter to continuously compute the sensitivity of midprice change relative to
order flow.
Given the evidence that order flow can predict returns, it is no surprise
that institutional traders prefer to trade in dark pools (where trades gener-
ate no order flow) and with hidden orders (where order flow can only be
estimated quite roughly using the BVC method). This is perhaps also why
currency exchanges do not typically publish trades information in a timely
manner—why do that when one’s proprietary trading desk can make better
use of the information!

■Order Book Imbalance
We see from above that order flow, which is a function of signed trades and
not quotes, is predictive of midprice movement. In this section, we will
discuss research that uses quotes, or more specifically, order book imbalance
to predict midprice movement.
Order book imbalance is simply defined as the total bid size minus the
total offer size, normalized by their totals:
## 휌=
## V
## B
## −V
## S
## V
## B
## +V
## S
## ,(6.2)
whereV
## B
is the total bid size on the order book, andV
## S
is the total offer
size on the book. Some researchers have found that it is often sufficient to
capture the BBO size in equation 6.2, ignoring the rest of the book. Cartea,
Jaimungal, and Penalva (2015) found that there is a significant correlation
between order book imbalance of a stock (ORCL) and future price change
that persists up to 200 seconds. Over a period of one second, the correlation
can be as high as 0.5. Naturally, the correlation may vary over time, and
over various stocks in question. Hence, a continuous adaption of a linear
predictive model just as we described at the end of the last section may be
applied here, too.
Also noted by Cartea, Jaimungal, and Penalva (2015) is another curious
phenomenon associated with order book balance: a buy imbalance attracts
buy market orders, and vice versa. If one is a market maker posting sell limit
orders, this is yet another reason to adjust the quote price upward when휌is
large and positive.
■Summary
Intraday trading is an attractive trading style, due to its typically shorter
drawdown and therefore a shorter time frame for validating or rejecting a
strategy. However, transaction cost has a larger impact on intraday strate-
gies’ profitability than on longer-term trades, since the profit on each trade
is lower. In an extreme case, if one is running a liquidity-rebate-earning
strategy, the profit of each trade will be measured in mils, not cents, per
share. We discussed many techniques in this chapter to reduce transaction
cost. They include reducing physical latency of signal generation and order
submission/confirmation and market data. They involve reducing the time

needed for order routing and gaining priority in the order queue on an
exchange’s order book by using special order types. They involve trading in
dark pools to avoid the bid-offer spread and hiding information. (Remem-
ber, order flow and order book imbalance is predictive of midprice change!)
And they involve avoiding adverse selection by choosing order types and
dark pools carefully. But even before we get to execute these strategies, just
backtesting them involves data and techniques that are much more onerous
than required for interday strategies. To make things worse, while interday
strategies may rely on ‘‘factors’’ that can last for years if not decades (see
Chapter 2, ‘‘Factor Models’’), intraday strategies often depend sensitively
on market microstructure that may change rapidly in response to regulatory
changes, the rise of high-frequency trading, and the introduction of new
technologies, exchanges, and algorithms. Alpha, after all, is ethereal.
■Exercises
6.1. Refer to the (bid-side only) order book displayed in Example 6.1.
A trader sends a market order to sell 600 shares to L.
a) What orders do L have to reroute, and to which exchanges?
b) Suppose that after the order was sent, but before it was executed,
N2’s NBB was increased to $10.03. Does L need to reroute part
of the order to N2?
6.2. Suppose we have only two exchanges, with their order books for a
stock shown below (only bids are relevant for this exercise):
Order Book for Exchanges L and N

## $10.03100
## $10.02100
## $10.01300
## $10.00200
The ‘‘protected’’ quote sizes are inbold. Note that L has the NBB.
A trader sends ‘‘sell 300 MKT IOC’’ to L. How many shares of this
order will be executed in total?
6.3. Referring to Box 6.3, suppose the bid price for EDH2 is 98.77 instead

a) Would the trader’s limit order to buy 50 contracts of H2M2 at
0.23 still result in a best bid size of 150 for H2, and a best offer
size of 150 for M2?
b) If a buy market order for 100 contracts of M2 arrives, would the
calendar spread limit order in (a) be filled?
c) If the trader sends a limit order to buy 50 contracts of H2M2 at
0.24, how would this affect the outright order book?
d) If the trader sends a limit order to buy 50 contracts of H2M2 at
0.21, would that add an implied-out quote to the outright order
book?
6.4. Modify code in Example 6.3 so that a trade tick that falls out of the
one-minute lookback window will update the aggregate order flow
value immediately, instead of waiting for the next trade tick for the
update. Similarly, update the past volume bars every 25 ms for trading
decisions. How do these modifications change the returns?

urrencies and bitcoins are the ideal playground for the quantitative
analyst. Unlike stocks, bonds, or their derivatives, they are quite
immune to fundamental factors (Lyons, 2001), at least on the shorter time
scales that we will be concerned with in this chapter. This is not to say that,
for example, a Fed interest rate decision would not affect exchange rates
(of course it would!), but that such fundamental events cannot be used as
predictivefactors. They are contemporaneous factors that can only be used
to explain exchange rates or bitcoins movement after the fact. Since as
traders we are mostly interested in predictions only, we might as well look
for the best technical analysis techniques instead.
When I mentiontechnical analysis, you may immediately think of the
Bollinger band, RSI, or stochastic indicators, and the like. But I use this term
in a very broad sense. I just mean predictive techniques that only require
prices and volumes as input. These include many of the tools we discussed
in Chapters 3 and 4. Hence, this chapter provides another proving ground
for those techniques, and would be of interest to those of you who want a
fresh look at them without the baggage of too many methodological details.
Other techniques include order flow analysis and cross-exchange arbitrage.
Both of these techniques have wide applicability outside of bitcoins, and
bitcoins serve to highlight their power in a particularly simple context.
■Bitcoin Facts
Since bitcoin is a fairly new financial instrument, we will describe some of
its properties first. To a trader, bitcoin is just another foreign currency such

as EUR or AUD. Trading bitcoin against another currency is like trading
EUR.USD, AUD.USD, or in general, B.Q. B is called the ‘‘base’’ currency,
and Q is the ‘‘quote’’ currency. Here is a useful mnemonic: B is ahead of Q
alphabetically, hence base currency is always the first symbol. Conveniently,
we will always use bitcoins as the base currency, too. For example, BTC.USD
is the number of USD needed to buy 1 bitcoin, and BTC.CNY is the number
of CNY needed to buy 1 bitcoin. If the value of bitcoin increases against any
currency Q, BTC.Q will increase. Other than BTC.USD, BTC.CNY is the
most traded currency pair.
(CNY is the onshore version of the currency of China. This currency is
not freely exchangeable and its rate is regulated by the government to trade
in a narrow band. The offshore version of the Chinese currency CNHis
freely exchangeable at almost every FX broker. Unfortunately, I know of no
bitcoin exchange that allows us to trade BTC.CNH. So unless you live in
China, including Hong Kong, trading BTC.CNY is not very practical.)
There are over 40 bitcoin exchanges. As of this writing, the top five
exchanges with the most volume (measured in bitcoins) are BTC China,
BitStamp, Bitfinex, itBit, and btc-e. The first exchange is for BTC.CNY, and
the last four are for BTC.USD. Their latest exchange rates as well as volumes
can be viewed on bitcoincharts.com. While currencies typically do not trade
from 5 p.m. ET on Fridays to 5 p.m. on Sundays, nor on certain holidays,
bitcoin trades 24/7.
Compared to other risky assets, both volatility and kurtosis (which
measures tail risks) of bitcoin returns are high. Table 7.1 is a comparison
of the riskiness of bitcoin compared to other risky assets. We have
chosenMXN.USD as a risky asset for comparison because it is the most

for them when traders wish to express their views on this asset class. (ETF
data are obtained from csidata.com, FX data are from Interactive Brokers,
BTC.USD data are from BitStamp and compiled by Jonathan Shore. You can
download historical data directly from api.bitcoincharts.com/v1/csv/.)
Market risk is not the only risk we have to worry about when trading
bitcoin: There is also credit risk. According to Johansson and Tjernstrom
(2014), 45 percent of bitcoin exchanges fail due to thefts and hacks, taking
their investors’ deposits with them.
■Time-Series Techniques
As was discussed in Chapter 3, if we don’t know a lot about an instrument,
the first step is to run a time-series analysis on it using ARIMA. Fitting
## 2
the midprices of BTC.USD one-minute bar data from January 20, 2014, to
September 3, 2014, to an AR(p) model (see equation 3.2 and the method-
ology described in Chapter 3) results inp=16 and휙
## 1
=0.685 with a
standard error of 0.0001. Hence, this time series seems strongly mean-
reverting. We can also run the ADF
## 3
test for stationarity described in
Example 2.1 of Chan (2013) on this time series:
results=adf(mid(trainset), 0, 1);
prt(results);
which comes back with a ADF test statistic of –3, while the critical value at
95 percent level is –2.9. So the ADF test also confirms that the BTC.USD
price series is mean-reverting and stationary. Hence a mean-reversion trad-
ing strategy promises to be successful. But before we try that, let’s just use
AR(16) to predict the next price and buy or sell based on that prediction on
the test set from September 3, 2014, to January 15, 2015. (This is the same
strategy applied to AUD.USD in the Section on AR(p) in Chapter 3.) The
CAGR is 40,000. The equity curve for the test set is shown in Figure 7.1.
Is this return realistic? Of course not. One would need to assume that a
limit order at midprice is always filled instantaneously to achieve this result.
Nevertheless, it serves to illustrate that a simple AR(p) model has quite a bit
of predictive power here.
We should also try ARMA(p,q) on BTC.USD. Following the same steps
as we did for AUD.USD in the Section on ARMA(p, q) in Chapter 3, we
find that the optimalpandqarep=3andq=7. We can then estimate

BTC.USD, and use the resulting model to make one-step-ahead prediction
as in the AR(16) case. Over the same test set, the CAGR is 3.9, which is
still fantastic but much lower than the AR(16) model. The equity curve
(Figure 7.2) also looks very different.
■Mean Reversion Strategy
As we have ascertained via an AR(16) model as well as an ADF test in the
previous section, the midprices of BTC.USD is a mean-reverting, stationary,
time series. This means a lot of simple mean-reverting strategies described
in Chan (2013) can be applied here.
The most well-known mean reverting strategy is the Bollinger band
strategy, where we buy a unit of BTC.USD when the midprice iskmoving
standard deviations below the moving average, and sell when it is above.
We will exit a position when the price mean reverts to the current moving
average. This is illustrated in Figure 7.3. The moving standard deviation

Of course, we would still need to optimize the lookback as well as the
multipleentryZscore. But we take the liberty of just arbitrarily deciding
that the lookback should be 1 hour (60 bars for our minute-bar data) and
entryZscoreshould be 2. Running this on the same test set in the previous
section (even though we didn’t use the trainset for any training) yields a
CAGR of 42 percent, with the equity curve displayed in Figure 7.4.
■Artificial Intelligence Techniques
Just like time series analysis, machine learning algorithms are another group
of techniques that are helpful when we are faced with a market whose behav-
ior is new to us, and we have not yet developed intuition about price patterns
and arbitrage opportunities that may exist. So let’s apply some of the algo-
rithms we learned in Chapter 4 to the one-minute bar BTC.USD data. To
avoid learning spurious effects such as bid-ask bounce, we will again use
midprices for our analysis in this section throughout.

Trim Size: 6in x 9inChan  c07.tex  V2 - 12/11/2016  12:44 A.M.  Page 207

The first technique we will try is the regression algorithm with bagging.
We merely copy the rTreeBagger.m program
## 5
to apply to the data here. But
instead of usingret1,ret2,...,ret20as predictors, we use 1-, 5-, 10-, 30-,
and 60-minute bars returns. I will not display either the CAGR or the equity
curve on the test set (which is the second half of the data set from January 20,
2014, to January 15, 2015), because they are simply too high to be realistic.
This strategy clearly calls for a more careful backtest using bid-ask quotes.
The second technique is the support vector machine. We can just copy the
code svm.m from Chapter 4,
## 6
using the new predictors above. Lest you think
that everything that worked with SPY will work even better with BTC.USD,
here you will find quite negative returns for both train and test sets.
Finally, we will apply the feedforward neural network that we discussed
in Chapter 4 as well.
## 7
We will use a network with just one hidden layer and
one neuron on that layer, but we will train 100 such networks with different
initial guesses of the network parameters and average the predicted returns
over all these networks. The out-of-sample return is as astounding as the one
using the regression tree technique above, subject to the same caveats.
■Order Flow
We discussed using order flow as an indicator for shortterm prediction in
Chapter 6. Recall that order flow issignedtransaction volume: if a transac-
tion of sizesis the result of a buy market order, the order flow is+s;ifitisthe
result of a sell market order, the order flow is−s. Some bitcoin exchanges
provide such data feeds with the ‘‘aggressor tag’’ that specifies whether a
trade is the result of a buy or sell market order. This is the case with the
BTC.CNY feed from BTC China and the BTC.USD feed from BitStamp.
We will use a one-month sample of the BTC.USD trade tick data from Bit-
Stamp to illustrate a trading strategy that uses order flow as a predictor.
These data are time-stamped to microseconds.
The trading strategy is in principle very simple. At the end of every
microsecond bar, we look for all trade ticks within the past minute, and
compute the order flow in that period. If this order flow is greater than
some threshold, we send out a buy market order to buy a unit of BTC.USD,
and vice versa for a sell market order. We will exit the resulting position,
again using market orders, whenever the one-minute order flow is zero
or has the opposite sign from the one triggering the entry. The problem
with this algorithm is that there are too many microsecond bars to loop

through, and the program may need to run for a very long time. So we will
instead backtest a simplified version of this strategy, using an event-driven
algorithm where we only compute order flow and decide whether to
generate a trading signal when we encounter a trade tick. We also assume
that our trade can be filled using this trade price, instead of using the
current best bid or offer price. This is the same simplification we made in
Example 6.3. The code details are discussed in Example 7.1. Naturally,
both the entry threshold and the implicit exit threshold of zero, as well as
the lookback period of one minute, should be optimized in-sample and
tested out-of-sample.
The backtest shows a profit of US$0.097 per one-sided trade. With 336
such trades in December 2014, this translated to a profit of US$32.54 per
coin, or an annualized return of approximately 100 percent. Of course,
we should really be backtesting this high frequency strategy using bid-ask
quotes, as we have to execute this strategy by buying at the ask and selling
at the bid. With a bid-ask spread of about US$0.12, the transaction cost per
trade is about US$0.06, which is still lower than the gross profit we com-
puted. So there is hope that the strategy can generate a net profit, depending
on the commissions that need to be paid. At the very least, this demonstrates
that order flow is a reasonable predictor for bitcoin for this time frame.
Example 7.1: An order flow strategy
This example is similar to Example 6.3. It is very fortunate that
we have access to the historical trades data from BitStamp that are
time-stamped at microseconds and more importantly, include the
aggressor tag. This tag allows for accurate computation of order flow
for our strategy. We save the aggressor tag in an array calledside,
whereside=1 indicates it is due to a buy market order, andside=−1
indicates it is due to a sell market order. We will also save the trade
size and price in arrays calledtradeSizeandtradePricerespectively, and
compute the order flow as
ordflow=zeros(size(tradePrice));
ordflow(buy)=tradeSize(buy);
ordflow(sell)=-tradeSize(sell);
and the cumulative order flow as
cumOrdflow=smartcumsum(ordflow);

We will also keep track of the time stamp in an arraydn,which
contains the MATLAB datenum of the trades. All these arrays have
the same dimension as the number of trade ticks. But note that trade
ticks are not evenly spaced in time: There often are many consecutive
microsecond bars that do not have any ticks and will not show up,
and theoretically there can be multiple trades that share the same
microsecond (though much less likely). If we go through these trades
one-by-one, we can easily compute the net order flow within the last
one minute:
for t=1:length(cumOrdflow)
idx=find( dn  <= dn(t)-lookback/60/60/24);
if (∼isempty(idx))
ordflow_lookback=cumOrdflow(t)-cumOrdflow(idx(end));
end
end
Theordflow_lookbackcomputed above can certainly be used to trig-
ger a trade, whether for entry or exit. But even if time elapses without
trades, the order flow within the last minute still needs to be updated.
We are not actually doing that—we loop over only time bars that have
trades, otherwise the program will take much longer to finish. What
we are backtesting is really a slightly different version of the strategy
described in the main text—one which is simpler to backtest. In this
version, we only enter or exit when a trade occurs, therefore we only
need to compute the order flow in the last minute at that time. For
the original version, we will need to backtest with trades and quotes
(TAQ) data, in addition to a more intelligent way to ‘‘fast forward’’
when there is no trade tick. (The backtest of this version will be left as
an exercise.)
Continuing with our simplified strategy, we can insert the trade sig-
nal generator in the if-block right after we computeordflow_lookback:
if (ordflow_lookback > entryThreshold)
if ( pos <= 0)
if (pos < 0)
dailyPL=dailyPL+(entryP-tradePrice(t));
dailyNumTrade=dailyNumTrade+2;
entryP=tradePrice(t);
else

entryP=tradePrice(t);

pos=0;
elseif (ordflow_lookback >= -exitThreshold && pos < 0)
dailyPL=dailyPL+(entryP-tradePrice(t));
dailyNumTrade=dailyNumTrade+1;
pos=0;
end
end
Before entering into the for-loop, we should first initialize pos=0
pos=0;
dailyPL=0;
dailyNumTrade=0;
If we setentryThresholdto 90 andexitThresholdto 0, this simplified
strategy generates a gross P&L of $32.54 for one unit of BTC.USD in
December 2014, or $0.097 per one-sided trade, assuming that we can
get filled at the same trade price that triggered our trade. The complete
code can be downloaded as orderFlow2.m.

■Cross-Exchange Arbitrage
Cross-exchange arbitrage is only possible when the best bid price of an
instrument on one exchange is higher than the best ask price of the same
instrument on another exchange, so that we can buy at the market from the
second exchange and then turn around and sell at the market on the first
exchange, making a riskless profit.
There isn’t much opportunity for cross-exchange arbitrage in mature
financial markets. Let’s take the US stock market as an example. As we
discussed in Chapter 6, though there are more than 60 exchanges or dark
pools where one can trade AAPL, the ‘‘crossed market’’ situation described
above will rarely occur due to Regulation NMS (‘‘National Market System’’)
Rule 610 implemented by the SEC in 2005. Rule 610 requires an exchange
to avoid displaying quotations that will cross the BBO quotes of another
exchange (‘‘Rule 610,’’ 2005). There goes our arbitrage opportunity!
There is still the possibility of engaging incross-bordercross-exchange arbi-
trage in stocks. For example, since IBM is traded in both NYSE and the LSE
(London Stock Exchange), we may be able to spot the occasional crossed
market situation after taking into account the exchange rate GBP.USD. But
to make this trade really riskless, one has to hedge our currency risk. So, for
example, if we bought some shares of IBM on LSE and sold equal number of
shares of IBM in NYSE, we are essentially short GBP and long USD. We need
to simultaneously buy some GBP.USD in order to hedge this currency expo-
sure. This adds transaction costs and will reduce or eliminate our arbitrage
profit.
In bitcoin markets, on the other hand, the opportunity for cross-exchange
arbitrage is seemingly abundant. Let’s look at one example. At 7 p.m. EST
on February 2, 2015, BTC.USD had the following bid-ask quotes on two
exchanges:
## Bitfinex: 239.19–239.48
btc-e: 233.232–233.546.
Why not sell a coin at $239.19 on Bitfinex, and immediately buy a coin at
$233.546 on btc-e, and earn a gross profit of US$5.644? In fact, the market is
crossed like this for many days, even months. So why not do this continuously
and becomes an overnight millionaire? To analyze whether there is really a
free lunch to be had here, we have to look closely at the costs of the trade.
First, there is a commission of about 20 bps per side, which is about $1 for
the complete transaction. Second, if we were to execute this continuously,

we need to regularly withdraw a coin from btc-e and transfer it to Bitfinex to
cover our short position there. This withdrawal will cost about 1 percent,
or $2. So we are left with about $2.6 net profit per coin—still excellent!
But lastly, we have to be mindful why the quotes are lower at btc-e. That is
because the market judges it to have a lower credit rating. Since we have a
long position there, we are exposed to credit risk.
## 8
We have no easy method
to compute whether this credit risk is higher or lower than the $2.6 per
coin profit.
■Summary
I have provided a whirlwind tour of some of the trading opportunities
present in the bitcoin market. Bitcoin markets are still relatively immature
compared to the stock or currency markets and, hence, there are still
many inefficiencies and thus potentially profitable arbitrage opportunities.
Some of these profits look outlandishly high—but are they real? That
partly depends on your execution software’s sophistication, the exchange’s
API efficiency, and its commissions and other fees, and finally, the credit-
worthiness of the exchange.
But beyond bitcoin, we also demonstrated how some of the techniques
we developed in the previous chapters, such as time-series analysis and arti-
ficial intelligence, can be brought to bear on an unfamiliar market. We also
demonstrated the power of a universal short-term indicator—order flow—
and pointed out the mechanics of a cross-border, cross-exchange arbitrage
that may be applicable to many more mature markets.
■Exercises
7.1. Try the AR(p) and ARMA(p,q) models on BTC.USD on lower fre-
quency time series such as 5-minute, 15-minute, and daily bars. Daily
data can be downloaded from api.bitcoincharts.com/v1/csv/.
7.2. Backtest the strategy described in Example 7.1 where we may enter
a trade even when there were no historical trades in a microsecond
time bar. The best bid offer (BBO) data is available to download as
2014-12_bbo.csv. Why must we backtest with BBO data in this case?
Are there cases where we would enter into a new position with this
strategy while our simplified version described in Example 7.1 would
not? Is this version more or less profitable than the simplified version?

## Trading Is Good
for Body and Soul
## B
efore we start engaging in a complex, time-consuming, and possibly
risky venture, it is often a good idea to pause and ask why we should
do it. Even if we have already been doing it for years, and have invested
countless hours and dollars, it is still worthwhile to ask if we should con-
tinue doing it. (Sunk cost is not a rational justification.) Now that we have
surveyed the highly technical side of algorithmic trading, perhaps it is time
to ask these high-level questions.
■Your Mind and Your Health
If you tell an acquaintance that you work as an algorithmic trader, it will
likely be assumed that your motivation is primarily financial. However,
statistics show that the majority of traders are unprofitable.
## 1
There are
much easier ways to earn a good living that do not involve bankruptcy risks.
Of course, the few especially smart and lucky quants will find lucrative jobs
at one of the big hedge funds where there is only upside and the downside
is limited to getting fired. But then, these elites can also find very lucrative
jobs at Silicon Valley, where a newly minted PhD graduate in artificial

intelligence was offered more than $1 million annual compensation (Markoff
and Lohr, 2016). So there must be more than financial consideration when
it comes to deciding to become an algorithmic trader.
From my years of interacting with algorithmic traders, an important
motivation for them is intellectual challenge. This is where mathematics,
computer science, and economics intersect. Just like science, algorithmic
trading offers a lifetime of opportunity for creative research. But unlike
most sciences, one can pursue this research with minimal infrastructure,
unencumbered by bureaucracy and the need to impress or convince others.
One can pursue this research until the last day of one’s life (which is my
present plan), without needing to ask the government or large corporations
for research grants. In short, one does not needpermissionto conduct this
research anywhere and at any time. I find this very appealing.
(Of course, this freedom is predicated on the assumption that one’s
trading strategies are at least moderately successful. But to increase the
likelihood of this success is the chief goal of this book.)
You may think that such a lofty goal as the freedom to pursue creative
research is not that important to you. You may think that all you want is a
stable income and a long and happy life. But how about this: Algorithmic
trading is also a good way to improve yourhealth. Research has found that
having a bad boss is harmful to one’s health and longevity (Porath, 2015), and
furthermore, time spent with any boss (not just bad bosses) is the top-most
reason for unhappiness (Kahneman, 2011). As an independent algorithmic
trader, you can escape from boss-related unhappiness. True, one can be
an entrepreneur in any field, but few other fields offer the opportunity to
extract financial value so directly from one’s intellect, and in a very scalable
manner, as algorithmic trading. Often, such personal attributes as manage-
rial acumen and marketing skills are equally important to entrepreneurial
success. Not so with algorithmic trading.
While we are on the theme of health and the avoidance of (constant)
stress, I should note that one of the main benefits of setting up your own
algorithmic trading operationat homeis that you will save time from com-
muting to the office. Unless you commute to work by walking or biking,
that hour or more each day is neither healthy nor stress-free. There are other
health benefits to working at home: the ability to get up and walk around
regularly. The Mayo Clinic website states, ‘‘Too much sitting also seems to
increase the risk of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer’’ (Levine,
2015). It felt strange when I worked at an institutional trading desk to stand
up and walk around every half-hour or so, but you can do that at home

without embarrassment. Finally, it is common knowledge that owning a pet
decreases stress (Doheny, 2012). Our cat, a Ragdoll, not only offers me her
support during periods of drawdowns, but also insists that I chase her around
the house every half-hour in the morning, compounding the health benefit.
You can hardly bring your cat to work on the trading floor of Goldman
Sachs. In addition to the presence of a pet, I have also found a continuous
streaming of music in my office to be soothing, but wearing a headset at
an institutional trading desk is bad optics (and so is wearing pajamas
at work).
It may seem counter intuitive, but working at home also enhances my
productivity. Many readers or colleagues have asked me how I can manage
a hedge fund and separate accounts, write books and blog posts, and teach
graduate finance classes, all at the same time. The answer is that working
around the clock and on weekends doesn’t feel like work in the comforts of
home. (Of course, working from home is becoming less possible for me as
our team expands to include new members who need to be physically close
by to maximize efficiency, learning opportunities, and most importantly,
serendipitous idea generation.)
You may like this lifestyle, but you may still hesitate because of the risks
of failure. The usual argument of signing up for a steady job is that, well, it is
steady. But is it? It didn’t work out that way for me,
## 2
and often not for anyone
in a position with P&L responsibility in any institution. Two of the institu-
tions that I worked for have either shut down, or are on the verge of it. The
banks that I have worked for have drastically scaled down proprietary trad-
ing activities due to the Dodd-Frank Act, and some of my colleagues who
worked hard to become managing directors have either been laid off or quit
of their own volition. Even if your firm is alive and well, your job typically
lasts as long as your cumulative profit is sitting at its high watermark. But if
your strategy is profitable, why do you need to work for anyone? Further-
more, by starting up your own algorithmic trading outfit, you can diversify
your career risks away from sole dependence on P&L. Nobody can stop you
from teaching, consulting, and writing books while building a robust port-
folio of strategies. As Nassim Taleb said (Taleb, 2014), running your own
business increases normal (read ‘‘Gaussian’’) fluctuations in your income,
but reduces tail risks, and is thusantifragile. Having a diversified income
stream greatly reduces the stress of a drawdown, and in fact, makes you a bet-
ter algorithmic trader because you can become more emotionally stable. An
additional virtue of such diversification is that teaching, consulting, and trad-
ing are synergistic. I learn quantitative techniques better by teaching them,

and as a result, teaching sometimes inspires new strategies. I also learned
much from the investment professionals that I taught and consulted for.
That’s why some prominent physicists (Richard Feynman comes to mind)
prefer to work in universities rather than pure research institutes where they
are free from teaching and supervising duties. They have found that teaching
and supervising smart students stimulates new ideas and avenues of research.
From a business relationships viewpoint, both of my partners in the hedge
funds that I founded or co-founded used to be my consulting clients, and
some of our largest investors have been readers of my books.
■Trading as a Service
Now that we have taken care of the personal benefits of algorithmic trading,
are there any societal benefits? Is this all just a selfish but amusing game?
If you think the currency conversion counters or ATMs in foreign airports
are useless, then you are entitled to think that trading is useless. As a foreign
currency trader, I stand as the wholesale counterparty behind these retail
counters and machines. Without us, consumers will likely have to pay more
for such conversions.
Some people despise trading and finance in general. They think the only
honest living is to manufacture physical products. However, our advanced
economy today is increasingly dependent on production of ideas and ser-
vices. If that’s the case, why celebrate video-game makers or movie directors
but not algorithmic traders? Some argue that trading is a zero-sum game,
producing no net benefit to society. But as I have shown above, a zero-sum
game is still useful to the society if it provides temporary liquidity to those
who invest for the long term.
## 3
Another oft-overlooked societal benefit of algorithmic trading is that it is
a business, and businesses provide for wages and incomes to their employees
and suppliers. In addition to tangible income, we mentor interns who have
STEM or business degrees, most of whom find productive jobs in finance
or other industries. Sometimes, they even help us create new, profitable
strategies.
One reason I offer my investment management service to others is to
further enhance the social utility of our trading. I believe I am a competent
and ethical investment manager. By offering my service, I hope to displace
from the marketplace incompetent or unethical investment managers.
Contrary to popular misconceptions, investment management is not just for

the wealthy. We are more than happy to manage investments from university
endowments or pension funds for teachers, healthcare workers, or other
public employees. I feel greatly honored to be entrusted with the task of
safeguarding the retirement assets and income of my clients. I will talk more
about managing other people’s money in the last section in this chapter.
■Does This Stuff Really Work?
Readers often ask me: ‘‘Are these strategies still profitable?’’ and my answer
is, inevitably, ‘‘Some are, some aren’t,’’ and that’s the truth. Strategies have
finite shelf lives, and more importantly, strategies that have been backtested
but not traded live (like most of the ones I described in this and my previous
books) may not even work at all out-of-sample.
There are two main reasons profitable strategies may stop being so:
macroeconomic or market structure changes, and competition from other
traders. In response, we can sometimes modify the strategies to adapt to
such changes or competition (e.g., entering or exiting a momentum trade
earlier). As for strategies that have only been backtested, I have discussed
at length in my previous books on how to spot flawed backtests (e.g., avoid
survivorship and data-snooping biases), and how to ensure that backtests
are more predictive of future returns. A major part of the skillset of a trader
is to decide when to start trading a strategy that only has backtest evidence
for profitability, and stop trading a strategy that is suffering a drawdown.
Often, the decision is partly based on statistical evidence (e.g., we are
more likely to start trading strategies with higher Sharpe ratio), and partly
based on understanding whether the fundamental economics of the trading
strategy still holds for the current market condition (e.g., we may postpone
trading a short volatility strategy until the market is calm). This is also the
only occasion when discretion meets algorithmic trading. But as with any
investment, the key is diversification. The more independent strategies we
have in a portfolio, the less chance that they will all stop working or have a
drawdown at the same time. I would strive for at least 10 strategies trading
live at any moment, with continuous births and deaths. As for the best way
to allocate capital among them, I discuss that in Chapter 2.
To illustrate, let’s examine two strategies I discussed in my previous
books.
One of the first strategies I introduced in Chan (2009) was the pair trad-
ing of GLD vs. GDX. In that book, I use the spread between GLD and GDX

Trim Size: 6in x 9inChan  c08.tex  V2 - 12/11/2016  12:44 A.M.  Page 220

as the input, and buy the spread whenever it falls below some threshold,
and sell it whenever it rises above another threshold. The threshold is deter-
mined based on the mean and standard deviation of the spread in a trainset. If
we run this strategy again using the first half of the data from May 24, 2006,
to May 1, 2013, as a trainset, we will find that the cumulative return is neg-
ative on the test set (the second half of the data). This is no surprise if we
look at a plot of the spread in Figure 8.1—it has kept increasing from 2011
until 2013 when it stabilized. It would, however, have been a great time to
start trading this pair again in 2013!
On the other hand, a similar pair, GLD vs. USO, backtested in Chan
(2013) using a Bollinger band strategy (i.e., where we continuously update
the mean and standard deviation of the spread in a 20-day lookback period)
continues to have positive returns.
If we are running just these two strategies in our portfolio, does it mean
thatinpracticewewouldhavezeroorevennegativenetreturnsoverthe

leverage of the GLD-GDX strategy as it lost money, until it was zero.
Meanwhile, we would have kept that of GLD-USO fairly constant. (This is
the Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance, or CPPI, scheme mentioned
in Chan, 2013.) This, and the fact that new strategies are continuously being
created and added to the pool, is how we survive the death of a strategy and
maintain net positive return. As Brett Steenbarger wrote in Dahl (2015),
‘‘...traders...find their ultimate edge in perpetual creativity.’’
■Keeping Up with the Latest Trends
As with any other technology-intensive business, algorithmic trading
evolves rapidly. The frequency of trading is increasing, the number of asset
classes traded algorithmically is increasing, the variety of available data is
increasing, and the variety of algorithms invented is increasing. I discussed in
Chapter 6 some of the issues related to the increasing frequency and decreas-
ing latency of trading. In terms of data, the race is on to extract information
from unconventional sources. Elementized newsfeeds and sentiment scores
are no longer new to traders, and I discussed some vendors who provide that
in Chapter 1. But I have heard of more outlandish data that involve satellites
and drone images of oil tankers, parking lots of retail stores, infrared heat
map of factories and industrial districts, and so forth, all to gain a leg up
on official crude oil, retail, and industrial production data releases (Kamel,
2016). A colleague told me about a firm that is even analyzing the voice
of company executives during conference calls to detect whether they
are lying, hiding something, or just plain gloomy despite the outwardly
cheerful projections. Some of these data must be analyzed using machine
learning algorithms due to their voluminous nature. Machine learning is
used directly in creating trading rules as well, a topic explored in Chapter 4.
Where can we keep track of all these new developments and knowledge?
The most efficient way for me is to follow the Twitter feeds of quant
news consolidators such as @quantocracy, @quantivity, and @carlcarrie.
These consolidators regularly tweet about publications of new papers or
blog posts. (I occasionally retweet their posts @chanep.) We can also visit
the blogs of jonathankinlay.com, tr8dr.wordpress.com, eranraviv.com,
godotfinance.com, quanstart.com, quantnews.com, factorwave.com, or
my own epchan.blogspot.com. But the virtue of Twitter is that someone
will notify you of new content on any of these and other websites. There
are also numerous forums and podcasts, online and off, that have active

■Managing Other People’s Money
Suppose you have decided that, like me, you would enjoy using your trading
skills to serve others. How would you go about it?
If you work as a trader in an investment bank, hedge fund, or a
high-profile proprietary trading firm, the fund-raising process won’t be too
hard. A typical way to raise money in this case is to pitch your business plan
to a prime broker who has a capital introduction service. Many such brokers
may not advertise that they have such a service, but they do informally.
So there is no harm in asking. Kroijer (2012) detailed the travails of such
a route.
But what if you have been an independent trader all along, albeit one
with a stellar track record? In recent years, a coterie of services have
sprung up to facilitate fundraising just for this type of trader. Most of them
take the form of an investment competition over varying periods and will
introduce the top performers to various capital providers. Many of them
host physical capital introduction events. In alphabetical order, these include
BattleFin.com, Battleofthequants.com, Fundseeders.com, Quantiacs.com,
Quantmasscapital.com, and Quantopian.com. The last site, of course,
offers much more than just capital introduction. It is a full-blown back-
testing and live trading portal, as discussed in Chapter 1. In addition, it is
backed by $250 million from Steve Cohen (Hall, 2016). There are also sites
such as iasg.com, managedfuturesinvesting.com, and rcmalternatives.com
that list the track records of futures traders (CTAs and CPOs). Naturally,
if you have to go through a capital introduction service to find clients, your
take of the fees will be reduced by the amount you have to share with them.
When I started as a fund manager in 2008, most of these services
did not exist. So how did I raise funds? It all started with my blog,
epchan.blogspot.com. Because of my blog, I got an offer to write my first
book. Because of my blog and books, I got offers to consult for other traders
or financial firms. Because of such consulting gigs, I got partners who not
only introduce capital (their own, and their family and friends’) to me
to manage, but actively contribute to building up our strategies portfolio
and technology infrastructure. Also because of my blog and books, there

have been media interviews, invitations to speak at conferences, teach
courses, and so on, which naturally generate more publicity for my money
management service. Of course, none of this publicity would mean much if
I had not treated our investors, consulting clients, and students decently.
Curiously, I have not found that going around town personally meeting
with prospective investors yields much benefits. Most of my investors have
never met me in person, and some have not even spoken to me on the phone.
As I mentioned above, my investors learned about me by first reading my
blog and books, taking my courses, or hiring me as a consultant. Many of
them did not think that they could tell whether I am a crook or a charlatan
from a one-hour meeting. This also relieves me of any pressure of trying
to impress people all within an hour. In particular, it is easy to be fooled
by charismatic people in physical meetings. I slowly built my reputation on
and offline as a decent person to work with over many years. This way of
building a business is also recommended by Grant (2014). I am mindful,
however, that this way of marketing a money management business may not
work well on large institutional investors, and may be too passive as we try to
accelerate asset growth. Some people do advise me to ‘‘get out there’’ more.
The relative unimportance of face-to-face meetings in investment deci-
sions does not, however, extend to research and ideas generation. I find it
crucial to discuss with people face-to-face in order to brainstorm and have
open-ended exchanges of ideas. People seem more spontaneous and unin-
hibited in sharing ideas in a physical social setting as opposed to an online
setting, which perhaps is counter intuitive in this age of social media. We
need in-person interactions for serendipitous discoveries. As they say, you
don’t know what you don’t know. Hence, I find my workshops in London
highly valuable. I also make sure my partner Roger and I (plus our quant
researcher Ray) attend conferences together, as we normally work out of
our respective homes at opposite corners of the continent (see a Bloomberg
profile of our business in Burger, 2016). If physical meeting of the team is
impractical, the new online collaborative platform slack.com is another way
to promote such informal communication among colleagues: People are far
more chatty with instant messages than with emails.
What is the exact business structure you should set up to serve the
investors you have attracted? Despite the common notion that ‘‘hedge
fund’’ is the investment vehicle of choice, it is actually far less hassle to first
start a service to manage separate accounts. It is far less of a hassle to attract
investors, because their money is sitting in their own brokerage accounts
under their control at all times. You are only given trading authority over

their accounts, but not authority to withdraw money. Many investors also
like managed accounts because of their transparency—they can watch
every day what is being traded in their accounts, what sort of risks are
being taken, and what the daily returns look like. It is also far less hassle to
manage separate accounts from a regulatory point of view. In the United
States, you do not even have to register as an Investment Advisor with the
SEC or a Commodity Trading Advisor with the NFA/CFTC if you advise
fewer than a certain number of accounts and meet certain other criteria.
Even if you do have to register, there is no required annual audit, no need
to hire a third-party administrator to perform treasury functions and to
send out monthly financial statements, and so on. You might think that it
is complicated to trade in multiple brokerage accounts simultaneously, but
many brokers have made it possible for you to just send one large order,
and they will allocate the resulting positions and P&L to various accounts
under your management according to some formula (usually proportional
to the NAV’s of the accounts). You may also think that it is complicated
to collect fees from multiple brokerage accounts, but again, some brokers
(such as Interactive Brokers) have automated this process (as long as you are
a Registered Investment Advisor or a Commodity Trading Advisor).
Some clients also prefer managed accounts because of the potentially
smaller margin requirement (i.e., they can employ higher leverage). In a
fund or pool, the manager decides the optimal leverage. For managed
accounts, clientscandeposit a relatively small portion of their total
investment capital into their accounts, and request that the manager trade
that at high leverage. However, ‘‘can’’ doesn’t mean ‘‘should’’: it is often
not optimal to trade an account at a leverage higher than what Kelly formula
recommends (see Chapter 1). We constantly adjust the order size for each
account based on the account equity and the desired leverage. Readers of
this and my previous books will understand that if this leverage is higher
than the Kelly optimal, the long-term compound growth rate under this
constant rebalancing scheme will suffer.
There are, however, some significant downsides to managingorinvesting
in separate accounts instead of a fund or pool. From the investment man-
ager’s point of view, it is never ideal to disclose the timing of every trade
of every instrument to your investors, as will be the case with managed
accounts. These leak your trade secrets. It is also difficult to execute multi-
plefuturesstrategies across multiple small accounts: the broker won’t be able
to allocate the futures contracts strictly according to the accounts’ NAVs.

Some small accounts may be allocated zero contracts randomly, and others
may be allocated one contract whose market value may already be bigger
than what is warranted.
Diversification is also a problem for managed accounts. In our fund, we
have many strategies that are allocated small amounts of capital. This may
be because a strategy has a short track record or may be because it delivers
good returns but not consistently. The sum total of these strategies may have
an attractive and stable returns profile, but they are difficult to replicate in
a managed account because many of these strategies will result in zero allo-
cation in a smaller account. Hence, true diversification is very difficult for
managed accounts, and this structure is best for investors who have invest-
ments in multiple managed accounts with different managers, and who can
achieve diversification on their own. But even if an investor can invest with
multiple managers, it is a big burden to manage the allocation of money to
them actively. In a fund or pool structure, we will manage such allocation on
behalf of the investor and will update such allocations regularly based on our
continuous analysis. Indeed, capital allocation (as discussed in Chapter 1) is a
big part of investment management. This is especially true with the constant
creation and destruction of strategies in a fund.
Finally, a major drawback of the managed account structure is the
principal-agent problem: The managers do not have skin in the managed
account. So it is all upside and no downside for them, and this encourages
the managers to take higher risks than may be optimal for the owner of the
account. On the other hand, you can choose to invest in a fund or pool

in
which the managers have substantial personal investment themselves and
who will suffer losses in the same percentage as outside investors.
■Conclusion
Nobel physicist Hans Bethe, a key figure in the Manhattan Project during
World War II and a beloved figure at my alma mater’s physics department,
was still conducting theoretical astrophysics research and giving public lec-
tures in his late eighties. Though algorithmic trading involves research that
is far more mundane, it still offers a lifetime of intellectual challenge and
financial reward. This book is just a snapshot of my ideas and thinking at
a moment in time during the endless cycles of creation and destruction of
trading strategies.
